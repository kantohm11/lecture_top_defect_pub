# Compact Boson {#sec-compact-boson}
Here we consider *compact* boson, where the field $\phi$ is real and subject to the identification
$$
\phi(x) \cong \phi(x) + 2\pi.
$$
We take the Lagrangian to be
$$
\mathcal{L} = \frac{R^2}{4\pi}\int_M \mathop{d\phi} \wedge \mathop{*}\mathop{d\phi}.
$$
We can normalize the field $\phi$ so that it has the kinetic term with a fixed coefficient, in which case the normalized field has a periodicity radius proportional to $R$.

The theory has the shift (or "momentum") $\U(1)$ symmetry 
$$
\phi^\alpha = \phi + \alpha 
$$
with identification of the parameter $\alpha \cong \alpha + 2\pi$.
One can add a periodic potential $V(\phi)$ and restrict oneself to a discrete symmetry preserving the potential.

In addition to the shift symmetry, the system has other generalized symmetries:

1. **winding** $\U(1)$ ($\stdim-2$)-form symmetry [@Gaiotto:2014kfa], and
2. when $\stdim=2$ and $R^2$ is rational, there exists a **T-duality** symmetry that is in general *non-invertible* [@Choi:2021kmx;@Niro:2022ctq:;@Cordova:2023ent;@Nagoya:2023zky].

The purpose of this section is to understand these generalized symmetries, but before that we review the shift symmetry.

## Trivial Operator and Shift Symmetry Operator
We start from the identity operator $\id[W^{\stdim-1}]$ that cuts and glues the path-integral. 
The construction is almost the same as before, but when we glue the fields $\phi_L$ and $\phi_R$ along $W^{\stdim-1}$, the gluing can be up to a integer multiple of $2\pi$:
$$
    \phi_L(x) = \phi_R(x) + 2\pi n 
$$
with an integer $n$ (assuming $W^{\stdim-1}$ is connected).
Therefore, the gluing part of the path-integral is
$$
\id[W^{\stdim-1}] = \sum_{n\in\mathbb{Z}}\int \mathcal{D}^{W^{\stdim-1}}\lambda \exp\left(\imunit\int_{W^{\stdim-1}} \lambda\left(\phi_L-\phi_R - 2\pi n\right)\right)\vol_{W^{\stdim-1}}.
$$
We can sum $n$ out to restrict $\lambda$ to satisfy
$$
    \int_{W^{\stdim-1}}\lambda \vol_{W^{\stdim-1}} \in \mathbb{Z}.
$$
An integration over such lambda can be replaced by
integration in terms of $(\stdim-2)$-form $\U(1)$ gauge field $V$ with
$$
\mathop{dV} = 2\pi \lambda\vol_{W^{\stdim-1}}.
$$
Therefore the identity operator can be written as[^DV]
$$
    \id[{W^{\stdim-1}}] = \int \mathcal{D}^{W^{\stdim-1}}V \exp\left(\frac{\imunit}{2\pi}\int_{W^{\stdim-1}} \mathop{dV}\left(\phi_L-\phi_R\right)\right).
$${#eq-identity-compact-boson}

[^DV]: We assume that the integration should be done over *gauge equivalent classes* of $V$. In other words the gauge fixing procedure is implicit in this lecture.

::: {.callout-note}
#### $p$-form gauge field
A $p$-form gauge field $V$ is *locally* (i.e.\ in a patch) $p$-form,
but $V$ is not necessarily a *global* $p$-form 
and $\mathop{dV}$ rather satisfy $\int_{\Sigma_{p+1}}\mathop{dV}\in 2\pi \mathbb{Z}$ for any $p+1$ dimensional submanifold. 

If a reader is not familiar with this concept, one can assume $\stdim = 2,3$. When $\stdim=3$, $V$ is a usual (one-form) abelian gauge field, whose magnetic flux is quantized, while when $\stdim =2$, $V$ is a periodic scalar field.
About higher-form gauge field, a motivated reader can consult e.g.\ @Hsieh:2020jpj.
:::

Now the topological operator for the shift symmetry is simply
$$
    U_\alpha^\text{shift}[{W^{\stdim-1}}] = \int \mathcal{D}^{W^{\stdim-1}}V \exp\left(\frac{\imunit}{2\pi}\int_{W^{\stdim-1}} \mathop{dV}\left(\phi_L-\phi_R + \alpha\right)\right).
$${#eq-shift-compact-boson}

## Winding Symmetry
The compact boson theory has another topological operator of dimension 1 
(codimension $\stdim-1$), which is simply
$$
U^\text{winding}_\alpha[\gamma^1] = \exp\left(\imunit\alpha \int_{\gamma^1}\frac{\mathop{d\phi}}{2\pi}\right).
$${#eq-winding-op}
Given the periodicity, the integral $\int_{\gamma^1}\mathop{d\phi}$ for a closed $\gamma^1$ takes a value in $2\pi \mathbb{Z}$, and therefore the operator is invariant against deformation of $\gamma^1$.
This also indicates that the parameter $\alpha$ is $2\pi$ periodic.
According to @tbl-sym-classes, this topological operator should define a $\U(1)$ $p$-form symmetry with $p=(\stdim-2)$, called the **winding symmetry**.

What are the operators *charged* under the symmetry?
When $p \ge 1$ ($\stdim\ge 3$), the operator @eq-winding-op cannot act on a local (point) operator, because the one-dimensional submanifold $\gamma^1$ can always be deformed one configuration to another without colliding with a point. 
On the other hand, it can potentially act on a $p$-dimensional extended operator: @fig-one-form.

:::{#fig-one-form layout-ncol=2}

![](figures/one-form_act)


![](figures/one_form_passing)

Action of $p$-form symmetry operator $U_\alpha[W^{D-p-1}]$ on a $p$-dimensional operator $\mathcal{O}_q[\Sigma^p]$ of $p$-form charge $q$. We can consider the two types of actions, one is *encircling* action (left), and the other is the *passing* action (right). From the latter we can close the loop on the right of the $\mathcal{O}_q$, and contract the loop on the right hand side, to get the former type of action.
:::

However, the construction of a charged operator is a bit tricky. 
A way of doing it is to first insert the identity operator @eq-identity-compact-boson, then utilize the field $V$ on the identity operator to defing an operator charged under @eq-winding-op.
Concretely, the (non-topological) operator with winding charge $n$ can be constructed as
$$
\langle \mathcal{O}^\text{winding}_n[\Sigma^{D-2}] \rangle
= \int \mathcal{D}^{W^{\stdim-1}}V \exp\left(\frac{\imunit}{2\pi}\int_{W^{\stdim-1}} \mathop{dV}\left(\phi_L-\phi_R\right)+\imunit n \int_{\Sigma^{\stdim-2}}V\right).
$${#eq-dual-op}
Here, we take arbitrary $W^{\stdim-1}$ that contains $\Sigma^{\stdim-2}$, and the correlator is independent of the choice.
The coefficient $n$ has to be an integer for $\int_{\Sigma^{D-1}}$ to be invariant under global gauge transformations.

The operator @eq-dual-op is often defined as a "disorder" operator 
that enforces singular behavior. Here we see the explicit construction of such by *integrating in* the Lagrange multiplier $V$ on $W^{\stdim-1}$.

:::{.callout-note}
Note that the topological operator @eq-Ug-pathintegral is also of disorder-type; it enforces a jump of the field across $W$.
It is curious that, for symmetry of field transformation, the charg*ed* operators are direct to construct, while the symmetry topological operator was somewhat tedious to do;
and it is opposite for the winding symmetry, or more generally topological charges.

|                      | Field transformation | Topological charge | 
| -------------------- | -------------------- | ------------------ | 
| Charged operator     | not disorder         | disorder           | 
| Topological operator | disorder             | not disorder       | 

One aim of this lecture is to demystify the "disorder" operators -- they can be explicitly written in terms of correct set of Lagrange multipliers -- so that one can talk about the two types of the symmetry in a unified way.
:::




**FIXME:derivation of the charge, from EOM of V**

Now the Ward-Takahashi identity @eq-Ward-Takahashi formally follows from the topological-ness of @eq-winding-op. Explicitly, we have
$$
\langle \prod_i \mathcal{O}^\text{winding}_{n_i}(x_i)\rangle 
=
\langle \prod_i e^{\imunit \alpha n_i} \mathcal{O}^\text{winding}_{n_i}(x_i)\rangle 
$$
for any $\alpha$. And thus the both sides vanish unless $\sum n_i = 0$.

## Mixed Anomaly between Shift and Winding Symmetry

### Intersection

Having explicit descriptions of topological operators enables us to directly compute **quantum anomaly** (often called 't Hooft anomaly) of the symmetries. 
This is because, from a modern perspective, the anomaly is a subtlety arises when symmetry operators collide.
Here we observe one example of anomaly -- the mixed anomaly between the shift and winding symmetry in the compact boson theory -- explicitly from the topological operator perspective.
For a general theory about anomaly and topological operator, readers can consult other resources, e.g. @TachikawaTasi.

Let us study the intersection of $U_\alpha^\text{shift}[W^{\stdim-1}]$ (@eq-shift-compact-boson) and $U_\beta^\text{winding}[\gamma^1]$ (@eq-winding-op). **FIXME:figure**
The shift symmetry operator divides $\gamma^1$ into $\gamma^1_L$ and $\gamma^1_R$, and the winding operator thus now, naively, look like
$$
\begin{aligned}
U^\text{shift}_\alpha U^\text{winding}_\beta[\gamma^1] &\stackrel{\text{naive}}{=} U^\text{shift}_\alpha \exp\left(\imunit\beta \left(\int_{\gamma^1_L}\frac{\mathop{d\phi_L}}{2\pi} + \int_{\gamma^1_R}\frac{\mathop{d\phi_R}}{2\pi}\right)\right)\\
& \sim U^\text{shift}_\alpha \exp\left(\imunit\beta/2\pi (\phi_L(x_0) - \phi_R(x_0)) \right),
\end{aligned}
$$
where in the second line, $\sim$ refers to the contribution local to the intersection point $x_0$ (i.e. we ignored the contribution from the other ends of $\gamma^1_L$ and $\gamma^1_R$ far from $W^{\stdim-1}$).
However, the shift symmetry defect enforces $\phi_L = \phi_R - \alpha \mod 2\pi$, but the local contribution at $x_0$ *depends* on $\phi_L-\phi_R \mod 2\pi$. Therefore the naive definition of intersected operator is not well-defined (or, it becomes zero if we average over the branches of $\phi_L(x_0) -\phi_R(x_0)$).

A way to define the intersection is to abandon the periodicity of either of $\alpha$ or $\beta$.
If we regard $\alpha$ to be in $\mathbb{R}$ and not $\mathbb{R}/2\pi\mathbb{Z}$, we can modify the above naive definition to be
$$
\begin{aligned}
U^\text{shift}_\alpha U^\text{winding}_\beta[\gamma^1] &\stackrel{\text{def1}}{=} U^\text{shift}_\alpha \exp\left(\imunit\beta \left(\int_{\gamma^1_L}\frac{\mathop{d\phi_L}}{2\pi} + \int_{\gamma^1_R}\frac{\mathop{d\phi_R}}{2\pi} + \{\alpha/2\pi\}\right)\right)\\
& \sim U^\text{shift}_\alpha \exp\left(\imunit\beta [\alpha/2\pi] \right),
\end{aligned}
$$
where $[r]$ is the integer part of a real number $r$, and $\{r\}= r-[r]$. With this definition, or regularization, of the intersection, $\alpha$ is no longer periodic, but $\beta$ is kept periodic.
One can do other regularizations where $\alpha$ is periodic but $\beta$ is not, or just abandon both of periodicity, but cannot save both.

This incompatibility of periodicity, or the group multiplication law, when topological operators intersects is the hallmark of anomaly. 

### Group Cohomology
The incompatibility above is better characterized as a group cohomology (or its generalization to a higher-group). 
Here we see how to characterize the mixed anomaly of the compact boson in 1+1d as a group cohomology element.
(Here we do not delve into the general theory of group cohomology. See e.g.\ @TachikawaTasi).

In 1+1d, both $U^\text{shift}_\alpha$ and $U^\text{winding}_\beta$ are line operators.
Both operators are $2\pi$ periodic in its parameters, when intersection between them are absent.
A more precise statement that applies even with intersections is that
$U^\text{shift}_\alpha$ and $U^\text{shift}_{\alpha+2\pi}$ can be connected with an invertible topological line-changing operator or a *line-isomrphism* operator for short[^isom] (See also @fig-line-isom):
$$
 \exp\left(\frac{\imunit}{2\pi} \int^\square \mathop{dV}(\phi_L-\phi_R -\alpha)  + \imunit V(\square)  + \frac{\imunit}{2\pi} \int_\square \mathop{dV}(\phi_L-\phi_R -\alpha+2\pi)  \right)
$$
where $\square$ denotes the point connecting two line operators. Note that the winding operator $e^{\imunit V(\square)}$ is precisely cancelled when the integral in the last term is evaluated, and thus the junction operator is topological. The existence of its inverse is also manifest.


[^isom]: In the language of category theory, such an invertible topological line-changing operator defines an *isomorphism* between the lines. In (higher)-category theory it is important to distinguish being isomorphic from being "the same", and in this context physically it means that we remember the total derivative terms on the line.

:::{#fig-line-isom layout-ncol=2}

![](figures/shift_2pi_isom){fig-align="center"}

![](figures/winding_2pi_isom){fig-align="center"}

Line-isomorphism operators.
:::

Likewise, the line isomorphism operator for the winding symmetry operator is 
$$
 \exp\left(\imunit \alpha \int^{\triangle} \frac{d\phi}{2\pi} + \imunit\phi(\triangle)  + \imunit (\alpha+2\pi)  \int_{\triangle} \frac{d\phi}{2\pi}  \right).
$$

We let the composition of the two lines be denoted by $U_{\alpha,\beta} = U^\text{shift}_\alpha U^\text{winding}_\beta$.
With it, we can define "naive" junction where two line operators $U_{\alpha_1,\beta_1}$ and $U_{\alpha_2,\beta_2}$ fusing into $U_{\alpha_1+\alpha_2,\beta_1+\beta_2}$.
However, the fused operator in general has parameters in the fundamental domain other than those of the fused ones.
Therefore, we normalize the junction by using the $\square$ and $\triangle$ isomorphisms so that the output is $U_{\langle \alpha_1+\alpha_2\rangle, \langle \beta_1+\beta_2\rangle}$, where $\langle \alpha \rangle = 2\pi\{\alpha/2\pi\}$; see @fig-junction-def.
The point is that this isomorphism results in a phase when crossing an intersection of the lines.

Now, we consider the two consecutive junctions, which fuses three lines $U_{\langle\alpha_i\rangle,\langle\beta_i\rangle}$ ($i=1,2,3$) into $U_{\langle\sum_i \alpha_i\rangle,\langle\sum_j \beta_j \rangle}$; see @fig-F-move.

![The anomalous phase from the F-move. We let $\alpha_{12} = \alpha_1+\alpha_2$, etc.](figures/f_move){#fig-F-move}

There are two ways of such fusion as depicted in the figure, and the two are related by a nontrivial phase which is
$$
f(g_1,g_2,g_3) = \alpha_1\left[\frac{\langle\beta_2\rangle}{2\pi}+\frac{\langle\beta_3\rangle}{2\pi}\right]+\beta_3\left[\frac{\langle\alpha_1\rangle}{2\pi}+\frac{\langle\alpha_2\rangle}{2\pi}\right],
$${#eq-cocycle-boson}
where $g_i = (\alpha_i,\beta_i)\in U(1)^2$.
The two configurations are gauge-equivalent, yet there is a non-trivial phase relating them. This is the *anomalous phase* of this anomalous $U(1)^2$ symmetry of 1+1d compact boson.


:::{.callout-note}
# Group cohomology

Mathematically speaking, the function $f : (U(1)^2)^3 \to \mathbb{R}/2\pi\mathbb{Z}$ is a 3-cocycle on the group $G=U(1)$; it satisfies the *pentagon identity*, depicted in @fig-pentagon.

Futher, it is subject to an ambiguity; we can modify the junction by a phase $h(g_1,g_2)$. This modifies the anomalous phase $f$ as
$$ f(g_1,g_2,g_3) \mapsto f(g_1,g_2,g_3) + (\delta h)(g_1,g_2,g_3)
$$
where $\delta h : (U(1))^3\to \mathbb{R}/2\pi\mathbb{Z}$ is the following function called a *coboundary* (FIXME:sign?):
$$
(\delta h)(g_1,g_2,g_3) = h(g_1,g_2) + h(g_1g_2,g_3) - h(g_1,g_2g_3) - h(g_2,g_3).
$$
The third **group cohomology** is an element of the quatient group
$$
H^3 = \{f\in\Map(G^3,\mathbb{R}/2\pi\mathbb{Z})\mid\text{pentagon eq.}\} / \delta(\Map(G^3,\mathbb{R}/2\pi\mathbb{Z})),
$$
where $\Map(X,Y)$ is the abelian group of $Y$ valued functions on $X$ [^Map].
This group cohomology classifies the anomalous phases of 1+1-dimensional bosonic theories with $G$-symmetry.
:::

[^Map]: When $G$ is continuous, the definition of $\Map(G^n,\mathbb{R}/2\pi\mathbb{Z})$ is subtle. The particular cocycle $f$ in @eq-cocycle-boson is not continuous, so we do not want $\Map(X,Y)$ to mean continuous maps. On the other hand arbitrary discontinuous maps would contain too wild cocycles to be realized in a QFT. In this particular case it seems considering *piecewise continuous* functions is necessary and sufficient. For general cases in general dimensions KO is not sure.

# Exercise: $\mathbb{Z}_2$ anomaly

The diagonal $\mathbb{Z}_3$ subgroup of $U(1)^2$ generate by $U_{2\pi/3,2\pi/3}$ is anomalous. Confirm this fact by calculating $f(g_1,g_2,g_3)$ for $g_i$'s in this subgroup, and also proving that no $h$ can satisfy $f = -\delta(h)$.
Optionally one might consider some other finite subgroups of $U(1)^2$.

# Comparison to more conventional calculation. 

The mixed anomaly between the shift and winding symmetry in 1+1d compact boson is usually computed from the two-point function of the corresponding current operators. Such computation corresopnds to *non-flat* and infinitesimal background for the symmetries.
On the other hand, inserting topological operator corresponds to *flat* and finite background. The two computations results in the same result is quite non-trivial, and is explained by the Chern-Weil theory.

While the computation based on non-flat background is easier, it is only for continuous symmetries and not obvious how it restricts to a finite subgroup, for example.
:::


## T-duality 

The compact boson in $\stdim=2$-dimensions famously has *T-duality*.

The T-duality is equivalence between the compact boson with radius $R$ and radius $\frac{1}{R}$,
and maps the shift (or momentum) symmetry of one side to the winding symmetry of the other side, and vise versa.
Note that this makes sense because in $\stdim=2$ the winding symmetry is a 0-form symmetry.

When the radius is the self-dual radius $R=1$, the duality becomes a (conventional) $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry, which is a part of the larger emergent $\SU(2)$ symmetry.

In this section we study

1. the explicit construction of the T-duality topological interface connecting radius $R$ and $1/R$ theories [@Kapustin:2009av], and
2. its generalization giving **non-invertible** symmetry (i.e.\ self-dual topological interface) at $R=\sqrt{N}$ for an integer $N$.

The latter can further be generalized to the case of rational $R^2$ [@Niro:2022ctq;@Cordova:2023ent].

### T-duality topological interface
Here we study the T-duality topological interface connecting two compact boson theories in $\stdim=2$-dimensions; with radius $R$ and radius $1/R$.
**FIXME:figure!**
When $R=1$, the interface is a topological operator within the same thoery, and thus defines a symmetry. 
In this case it turns out a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry, known to be contained in the larger $\SU(2)$ enhanced symmetry.

According to [@Kapustin:2009av], the partition functino involving the interface is
$$
\begin{multlined}
\langle \mathcal{O}_L \mathcal{I}^\text{T}_1[W] \mathcal{O}_R  \rangle= 
\int \mathop{\mathcal{D}^{M_L}\phi_L}\mathop{\mathcal{D}^{M_R}\phi_R}
\mathcal{O}_L[\phi_L]\mathcal{O}_R[\phi_R]\\
\exp\left(-\frac{R^2}{4\pi}\int_{M_L}\mathop{d\phi_L}*\mathop{d\phi_L}
-\frac{\imunit}{2\pi}\int_W \phi_L\mathop{d\phi_R}
-\frac{1}{4\pi R^2}\int_{M_R}\mathop{d\phi_R}*\mathop{d\phi_R}\right).
\end{multlined}
$${#eq-T-interface}
For simplicity let us take $\mathcal{O}_R =1$, and $M_R$ be a compact region in the spacetime.
In this case, we expect the supposed topological-ness implies
$$
\langle \mathcal{O}_L \mathcal{I}_1^\text{T}[W]\rangle = \langle \mathcal{O}_L \rangle.
$$
To show this, we replace the variable $\phi_R$ with $F_R = d\phi_R$ by
$$
\int \mathcal{D}\phi_R = \int \mathop{\mathcal{D}F_R} \mathop{\mathcal{D}\widetilde{\phi}_R}
\exp\left(\frac{\imunit}{2\pi} \int_{M_R}\widetilde{\phi}_R \mathop{dF_R}\right),
$$
where the periodic scalar $\widetilde{\phi}_R$ is the Lagrange multiplier enforcing the closedness and the quantization of $F_R = d\phi_R$.
Substituting this into @eq-T-interface, the EOMs with respect to $F_R$ are
$$
\begin{aligned}
    \frac{1}{R} *d\phi_R(x) &= \imunit d\widetilde\phi_R(x) \quad \mathop{\text{for}} x \in M_R \\
    \phi_L(x) &= \widetilde{\phi}_R(x) \quad \mathop{\text{for}} x \in W.
\end{aligned}
$${#eq-EOM-FR-boson}
Substituting the former equation to the Lagrangea of $\phi_R$, we get
$$
    \frac{R^2}{4\pi} \int_{M_R}\mathop{d\widetilde{\phi}_R}*\mathop{d\widetilde{\phi}_R}
$$
with is the same as for $\phi_L$, while the latter of @eq-EOM-FR-boson connects $\phi_L$ and $\widetilde{\phi}_R$ along $W$.
 As a whole, we recover the path-integral over $M$ resulting in $\langle \mathcal{O}_L \rangle$.
For a more general topological-ness about local deformation of $W$ can be derived in the same way but with more letters.

Now, let us set $\mathcal{O}_R = \mathcal{O}^\text{winding}_n(x)$ and see how the topological interface acts on the operator. 
As the operator $\mathcal{O}^\text{winding}_n$ in @eq-dual-op is defined on the trivial surface operator, we have to divide the manifold into three parts: $M_L,M_M,m_R$, separated by $W_1$ and $W_2$. As the $M_L$ and field on it is not going to be relevant, we suppress them in the following equations.
The calculation goes as:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\mathcal{I}_1^\text{T} \mathcal{O}^\text{winding}_n(x)
&= \int \mathop{\mathcal{D}\phi_M}\mathop{\mathcal{D}\phi_R}\mathop{\mathcal{D}^{W_2}V}
\exp\left(-S_M^{1/R}-S_R^{1/R}-\frac{\imunit}{2\pi}\int_{W_1}\phi_L \mathop{d\phi_M}\right)\\
 &\times\exp\left(\frac{\imunit}{2\pi}\int_{W_2}\mathop{dV}(\phi_M-\phi_R) + \imunit n V(x) \right)\\
&= \int \mathop{\mathcal{D}F_M}\mathop{\mathcal{D}F_R}\mathop{\mathcal{D}^{W_2}V}\mathop{\mathcal{D}\widetilde\phi_M}\mathop{\mathcal{D}\widetilde\phi_R}\\
&\times\exp\left(-S_M^{1/R}-S_R^{1/R}-\frac{\imunit}{2\pi}(\int_{W_1}\phi_L \mathop{d\phi_M}-\int_{M_M}\tilde{\phi}_M\mathop{dF_M} - \int_{M_R}\tilde{\phi}_R\mathop{dF_R})\right)\\
 &\times\exp\left(+\frac{\imunit}{2\pi}\int_{W_2}\mathop{V}(F_M-F_R) + \imunit n V(x) \right)
\end{aligned}
$$
Now, the EOMs in terms of $F_M$ and $F_R$ state
$$
\begin{aligned}
    \frac{1}{R} *d\phi_{M,R} &= \imunit d\widetilde\phi_{M,R}(x) \quad \text{on} \;\; M_{M,R}, \\
    \phi_L &= \widetilde{\phi}_M \quad \text{on} \;\; W_1,\\
\tilde{\phi}_M &= V = \tilde{\phi}_R \quad \text{on} \;\; W_2.
\end{aligned}
$$
Thus by substituting back we get **FIXME:check the sign!**
$$
\mathcal{I}_1^\text{T}\cdots\mathcal{O}_n^\text{winding} = \mathcal{O}_{\pm? n}^\text{shift}.
$$


In addition, let us calculate $(\mathcal{I}_1[W]^\text{T})^2$.
For this, we insert the defects along parallel submanifolds $W_1$ and $W_2$ and take the limit where the separation of the two shrinks. **FIXME:figure**
This can be calculated as
$$
\begin{aligned}
\mathcal{I}_1^\text{T}[W_1]\mathcal{I}_1^\text{T}[W_2]
&= \int \mathcal{D}^{M_M}\phi_M \exp(-\imunit \int_{W_1} \phi_L d\phi_M - \imunit\int_{W_2} \phi_M d\phi_R)\\
&= \int \mathcal{D}^{W}\phi_M \exp(-\imunit \int_{W} (\phi_L - \phi_R) d\phi_M)\\
&= \id[W],
\end{aligned}
$$
where in the second line we collide $W_1$ and $W_2$, and noted that only the  mode of $\phi_M$ constant along the direction perpendicular to $W_1$ and $W_2$ contributes.
Therefore, the T-duality interface squares to the identity.
In particular, at $R=1$, the self-interface defines an invertible $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry.

### Non-invertible symmetry from T-duality
@Choi:2021kmx generalized the Kapustin-Tikhonov T-duality interface by @Kapustin:2009av
as 
$$
\begin{multlined}
\langle \mathcal{O}_L \mathcal{I}^\text{T}_N[W] \mathcal{O}_R  \rangle= 
\int \mathop{\mathcal{D}^{M_L}\phi_L}\mathop{\mathcal{D}^{M_R}\phi_R}
\mathcal{O}_L[\phi_L]\mathcal{O}_R[\phi_R]\\
\exp\left(-\frac{R^2}{4\pi}\int_{M_L}\mathop{d\phi_L}*\mathop{d\phi_L}
-\frac{\imunit N}{2\pi}\int_W \phi_L\mathop{d\phi_R}
-\frac{N^2}{4\pi R^2}\int_{M_R}\mathop{d\phi_R}*\mathop{d\phi_R}\right).
\end{multlined}
$${#eq-TN-interface}

$${#eq-TN-interface2}
We further rescale the fields as

$$
\begin{aligned}
V' &= NV \\
N \widetilde\phi_R' &= \widetilde\phi_R \mod 2\pi
\end{aligned}
$$
so that we have
$$
\begin{multlined}
\langle\mathcal{O}_L \mathcal{I}^\text{T}_N[W] \rangle = \mathcal{N} 
\int \mathop{\mathcal{D}^{M_L}\phi_L}\mathop{\mathcal{D}^{M_R}\phi_R}\mathop{\mathcal{D}^{W}V'}
\mathcal{O}_L[\phi_L]\\
\exp\left(-\frac{R^2}{4\pi}\int_{M_L}\mathop{d\phi_L}*\mathop{d\phi_L}
-\frac{\imunit }{2\pi}\int_W ( \phi_L - \widetilde{\phi}_R')\mathop{dV'}
-\frac{R^2}{4\pi}\int_{M_R}\mathop{d\widetilde\phi_R'}*\mathop{d\widetilde\phi_R'}\right).
\end{multlined}
$${#eq-TN-interface3}
To go from @eq-TN-interface3 to @eq-TN-interface2, we define a $\mathbb{Z}_N$ valued variable $n_{\widetilde{\phi'}_R} = [N\widetilde{\phi'}_R/2\pi] \mod N$ so that $\widetilde{\phi'} = \frac{2\pi}{N}(\{\widetilde{\phi}/2\pi\} + 2\pi n_{\widetilde{\phi'}_R})$. Then, after substituting it, the sum over $n_{\widetilde{\phi'}}$ enforces $V'$ be divisible by $N$ (that is, the winding of $V$ along $W$ is constrained to be a multiple of $N$).
Thus, we have
$$\langle\mathcal{O}_L \mathcal{I}_N^\text{T}[W]\rangle = \mathcal{N} \langle \mathcal{O}_L \rangle.
$$
We are not caring enough about the absolute size of path-integral measure to determine the normalization constant $\mathcal{N}$, but will determined in by another mean later.

#### Fusion rule
The product, or *fusion* of the generalized operator is
$$
\begin{aligned}
(\mathcal{I}_N^\text{T})^2 &= \int \mathcal{D}^W V \exp(\frac{\imunit}{2\pi} N \int_W \mathop{dV}(\phi_L-\phi_R))\\
&= \sum_{n=0}^{N-1} \int \mathcal{D}^W V' \exp(\frac{\imunit}{2\pi}  \int_W \mathop{dV}(\phi_L-\phi_R+ 2\pi n/N))\\
&= \sum_{n=0}^{N-1} U_{2\pi n/N}^{\text{shift}},
\end{aligned}
$${#eq-fusion-I}
where in the second line we did the chage of variable $NV = V'$, and enforced the divisibility of $V'$ by $N$ by the sum over $n$.
One can also see $\mathcal{I}_N^\text{T}[-W] = \mathcal{I}_N^\text{T}[W]$ (note that when we consider an operator on $W$ the notion of "left" and "right" also flips), so
$$
\mathcal{I}_N^\text{T}[W]\mathcal{I}_N^\text{T}[-W] = \sum_{n=0}^{N-1} U_{2\pi n/N}^{\text{shift}}.
$$
This contrasts to the case of conventional symmetry operator, where $U_g[W] = U_{g^{-1}}[W]$ and thus
$$
U_g [W] U_g[-W] = \id[W].
$$
In the case of $\mathcal{I}_N^\text{T}$, $N\ge 2$, the fusion with its orientation reversal is not the trivial operator, but a sum. This is a one of hallmarks of **non-invertible** symmetry. $\mathcal{I}_N^\text{T}[-W]$, called the **dual** of the original operator, is the closest possible thing to be the "inverse", but it fails to be so.
Therefore, the compact boson theory in 1+1d at $R=\sqrt{N}$ has the non-invertible T-duality symmetry.

Here, we can determine that the coefficient in the above equations are correct. 
This is because that we can insert the one-dimensional operator $(\mathcal{I}_N^\text{T})^2$
along the time direction, which should determine the *defect Hilbert* space.
On the right hand side, we should have a direct sum of defect Hilbert spaces for the involved invertible symmetry operators. There is no way to take "average" over Hilbert spaces, or divide it by a number, so we can assume the minimal possible coefficient is realized, which is the one in @eq-fusion-I.

Given @eq-fusion-I, the coefficient $\mathcal{N}$ in @eq-TN-interface3 is determined by
$$
\langle (\mathcal{I}_N^\text{T})^2[W] \rangle = \sum_{n=0}^{N-1}\langle U_{2\pi n/N}^\text{shift}[W] \rangle = \mathcal{N}^2,
$$
thus $\mathcal{N} = \sqrt{N}$. This quantity is called the **quantum dimension** of $\mathcal{I}_N^\text{T}$.

#### Action on the local operators
What is the action of $\mathcal{I}_N^\text{T}$ on the local operator $\mathcal{O}^\text{winding}_n$?
Naively repeating the procedure in the previous section, one might think
$$
\mathcal{I}_N^\text{T} \cdot \mathcal{O}^\text{winding}_n(x) \stackrel{?}{=} \mathcal{O}^\text{shift}_{n/N}(x)
$$
however the left hand side, $e^{\imunit n/N \phi}$, does not make sense when $N$ does not divide $n$ as it is incompatible with the periodicity of $\phi$.
Thus the right hand side vanishes unless $N | n$, and we have
$$
\mathcal{I}_N^\text{T} \cdot \mathcal{O}^\text{winding}_n(x) = 
\begin{cases}
e^{\imunit \frac{n}{N}\phi} & N|n \\
0 & \text{otherwise}.
\end{cases}
$$
Note that here we considered the *encircling* action (FIXME:Figure!!).
We can instead consider the *passing* action, in which case we have
$$
\mathcal{I}_N^\text{T}[W_L]  \mathcal{O}^\text{winding}_n(x) = 
e^{\imunit \frac{n}{N}\int_{\gamma^x} \mathop{d\phi}} \mathcal{I}_N^\text{T}[W_R],
$$
$W_{L,R}$ goes through the left/right side of the point $x$, and the path $\gamma^x$ starts from a point on $W_R$ and ends at $x$.


### Non-invertible T-duality for a rational $R$
We can further generalize @eq-TN-interface so that it is a self duality at $R^2 = p/q$ ($p$ and $q$ are taken to be coprime) [@Niro:2022ctq;@Cordova:2023ent].
The construction is 
$$
\mathcal{I}_{p,q}^\text{T}[W]=\int \mathop{\mathcal{D}^W a} \mathop{\mathcal{D}^W b} \exp\left(-\frac{\imunit}{2\pi}  \int_W (q \mathop{a} \mathop{db} +p \mathop{a} \mathop{d\phi_L} - b \mathop{d\phi_R} )\right),
$$
where $a$ and $b$ are periodic scalar fields on $W$.
The fusion is
$$
(\mathcal{I}_{p,q}^\text{T}[W])^2 = \sum_{n_1=0}^{p-1}\sum_{n_2=0}^{q-1}U^\text{shift}_{2\pi n_1/N}U^\text{winding}_{2\pi n_2/N},
$$
and the quantum dimension is
$$
\langle \mathcal{I}_{p,q}^\text{T}[W]\rangle = \sqrt{pq}.
$$
