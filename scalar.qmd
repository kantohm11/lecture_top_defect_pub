# Topological Operators for Classical Symmetry {#sec-scalar}

This section explores topological operators in the context of classical symmetry in scalar field theory.

## Set Up
For specificity, consider a complex scalar field theory with the following Lagrangian (density) on a spacetime $M$ of dimension $\stdim$:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\mathcal{L}(\phi) &=  - \left(\frac12 \partial_\mu \phi(x)^* \partial^\nu \phi(x) + V(\phi(x))\right)\vol\\
&= \frac{1}{2} \mathop{d\phi} \wedge *\mathop{d\phi} - V(\phi(x))\vol.
\end{aligned}
$$

In this equation, $\mathop{*}$ represents the Hodge star, $\vol = \mathop{*} 1 = \prod_{i=1}^{\stdim} \mathop{dx_i}$ is the volume form for the flat space, and $V(\phi)$ is the potential. Then, the action is given by:

$$
S[\phi] = \int_{M}\mathcal{L}(\phi).
$$

Consider a symmetry transformation of the scalar field as follows:

$$
\phi(x) \mapsto \phi^g(x).
$${#eq-scalar-transf}

We assume that this transformation is parametrized by an element $g$ in a group $G$, which is constant over $M$ and leaves the action invariant:

$$
S[\phi]=S[\phi^g].
$${#eq-action-inv}

This implies that the Lagrangian is invariant up to a total derivative:

$$
\mathcal{L}(\phi^g) = \mathcal{L}(\phi) + \mathop{ds}(\phi,g).
$${#eq-Lagrangian-inv}


In this equation, $s(\phi,g)$ is a $(\stdim-1)$-form on $M$ that depends on the constant $g$ and the field $\phi$. 
By taking $g=\id$ (the identity element of the group), we have $\mathop{ds}(\phi,\id) = 0$, and we further set the constant mode to be zero: $s(\phi,\id) = 0$.
Similarly, from the consequtive transformation with $g$ and $g^{-1}$, we set 
$$ 
s(\phi^g,g^{-1}) = -s(\phi,g). 
$${#eq-surface-term-inverse}

For instance, the standard $\U(1)$ rotation corresponds to the transformation:

$$
\phi^g(x) = \mathop{g} \phi(x),
$$

where $g=e^{\imunit \alpha}$ represents a $\U(1)$ phase. The potential $V(\phi)$ may partially break the $\U(1)$ rotation into its subgroup $\mathbb{Z}_k$. For example, when $V(\phi)\propto \phi^k+(\phi^*)^k$, the parameter $g$ takes *discrete* values: $g = e^{\imunit \frac{2\pi i}{k}}$, where $i$ ranges from 0 to $k-1$.

Moreover, when $V(\phi)=0$, the action $S[\phi]$ also admits the shift symmetry[^nonzero_r]:

$$
\phi^{\alpha}(x) = \phi(x) + \alpha.
$$

[^nonzero_r]: If we use the form of the Lagrangian $\mathcal{L}^\prime= -\frac12 \phi \mathop{d*d\phi}$, this provides an example where the total derivative in @eq-Lagrangian-inv is nonzero: $s=-\frac12 \alpha \mathop{*}\mathop{d\phi}$.

In this section, our goal is to construct the **topological operator** corresponding to these *classical* symmetries.

:::{.callout-note}
#### Note
This construction can be applied to various types of scalar field theory, such as real and/or multiple scalar fields, provided the kinetic term is standard enough (more details in @sec-trivial-scalar). Also note that the spacetime manifold $M$ and its metric do not need to be flat. The metric's signature is not significant in this lecture, even though we use Euclidean notation.

:::{.callout-note}
#### Note
In this lecture, we focus on constructing topological operators that correspond to the *finite* transformation @eq-scalar-transf, as opposed to the conventional approach of considering infinitesimal transformations. This approach allows us to explicitly discuss *discrete* symmetries (and their anomalies) in terms of topological operators, and it also motivates us to consider generalized symmetries.

## Construction of the Topological Operator
As a fundamental example of the correspondence @eq-conv-STO-corresp, we aim to construct the topological operator $U_\alpha[W]$ that corresponds to the transformation @eq-scalar-transf. Specifically, we will construct an operator $U_\alpha[W]$, defined on a codimension-1 submanifold $W$ of the spacetime $M$, that satisfies the following properties:

:::{.callout-important}
#### Properties of the Symmetry Topological Operator
1. Topological: $U_g[W] = U_g[W']$ if $W$ can be continuously deformed into $W'$ without intersecting other operators.
2. Symmetry action: When a deformation from $W$ to $W''$ intersects a local operator $\mathcal{O}$, it undergoes the symmetry action specified by $g$, resulting in another operator $\mathcal{O}^g$.
3. Noether: When the symmetry group is continuous, we can consider the group element as the infinitesimal deformation of $\id$: $g = \id + \alpha + \mathcal{O}(\alpha^2)$. In this case, the operator $U_g[W]$ is approximated by the Noether charge
    $$
    U_{1+\alpha+\mathcal{O}(\alpha^2)} = 1 + \alpha \int_W \mathop{*}j +\mathcal{O}(\alpha^2),
    $${#eq-Noether-approx}
    where $j = j_\mu\mathop{dx^\mu}$ is the Noether current one-form. **FIXME:sign is uncertain..**
    $$
    \mathop{*}j = \left.\frac{\delta\mathcal{L}(\phi^{1+\alpha(x)})}{\delta d\alpha}\right|_{\alpha=0} + \left.\frac{\partial s(\phi, 1+ \alpha)}{\partial \alpha}\right|_{\alpha=0}.
    $$
Note that when $W$ is a time-slice $W=\{t=0\}$,
$$
\int_W \mathop{*} j = \int_{\{t=0\}} j^0 \mathop{d^{\stdim-1}x}
$$
is precisely the Noether charge as described in any QFT textbook.

Properties 1 and 2 are summarized in @fig-op-action.

![The topological operator $U_g[W]$ is designed to be invariant under a continuous deformation and to implement the symmetry action.](figures/Op_action.svg){#fig-op-action width=400}

The construction is based on the concept of "cutting-and-gluing-with-twist".
Initially, we partition the spacetime $M$ into two subregions: $M_\stdim = M_L \cup_W M_R$ with a common boundary $W$ (refer to @fig-cut-M. We orient $W$ such that $\partial M_L = -\partial M_R = W$.).
We also divide the scalar field $\phi$ into two fields: $\phi_L(x)$ for $x \in M_L$ and $\phi_R(x)$ for $x \in M_R$. Subsequently, we reconnect the two regions and their respective fields, with a twisted identification: 
$$ \phi_L|_W = \phi_R^{g^{-1}}|_W. $$

![The cutting and twisted gluing, implementing the topological operator $U_g[W]$.](figures/ManifoldSplit.svg){#fig-cut-M width=230}

In path-integral, this construction can be implemented as follows:

::: {.callout-important}
#### Symmetry Topological Operator for a Classical Symmetry
$$
\begin{multlined}
    \langle U_g[W] \cdots \rangle = \int \mathop{\mathcal{D}^{M_L}\phi_L} \mathop{\mathcal{D}^{M_R}\phi_R} \mathop{\mathcal{D}^W\lambda} \cdots\\ \times \exp\left(-S_L[\phi_L]-S_R[\phi_R] - G_W[\lambda,\phi_L,\phi_R,g]\right)
\end{multlined}
$${#eq-Ug-pathintegral}
:::

Here, $\mathcal{D}^{X}$ denotes the measure for the path-integral for a field defined on a submanifold $X$ of the spacetime $M$. The actions on the submanifold $M_{L,R}$ are written as $S_{L,R} = \int_{M_{L,R}}\mathcal{L}(\phi_{L,R})$, and "$\cdots$" denotes additional operator insertions. The "gluing" action $G_W$ on the submanifold $W$ is defined as
$$
%\begin{multlined}
    G_W[\lambda,\phi_L,\phi_R,g] = - \imunit \int_W \lambda(\phi_L - \phi_R^{g^{-1}})\vol_W+\int_W s(\phi_M,g).
%\end{multlined}
$${#eq-gluing-action}
The key point of the above expression is that integrating the Lagrange multiplier $\lambda$ results in the "delta functional":
$$
    \int \mathop{\mathcal{D}^W\lambda} \exp\left(\imunit \int_W \lambda (\phi_L-\phi^{g^{-1}}_R)\vol_W\right)
     = \prod_{x\in W}\delta(\phi_L(x) - \phi_R^{g^{-1}}(x)),
$${#eq-delta-functional}
which should implement @fig-cut-M.
Before studying the operator $U_g[W]$, we should first examine the *trivial* case where the symmetry transformation $g$ is the identity map $g=\id$.
$$
\langle \id[W] \cdots \rangle = \langle \cdots \rangle.
$${#eq-identity-wall}
We refer to the codimension-1 operator $\id[W]$ with this property as the **identity wall**. It can also be termed as the **transparent wall** or similar.
Upon expanding @eq-identity-wall, the following equation should be satisfied:
$$
\begin{multlined}
    \int \mathop{\mathcal{D}^M\phi} \exp(-S) \cdots=
    \int \mathop{\mathcal{D}^{M_L}\phi_L} \mathop{\mathcal{D}^{M_R}\phi_R} \mathop{\mathcal{D}^W\lambda} \\ \times \exp\left(-S_L-S_R+\imunit \int_W \lambda(\phi_L - \phi_R)\vol_W\right)\cdots.\\ 
\end{multlined}
$${#eq-trivial-scalar}

The key distinction between providing a field $\phi$ on $M$ and providing a pair of fields $(\phi_L,\phi_R)$ on $(M_L,M_R)$ is that the latter is not required to be continuous across $W$. On the right-hand side, continuity is enforced by integrating out $\lambda$ due to @eq-delta-functional.

# Continuity of Fields in "Exotic" QFTs and Subsystem Symmetry
In this context, we assume that the path integral $\int\mathcal{D}^M\phi$ should be over the *continuous* fields. This is because the standard kinetic term would diverge when the field $\phi$ becomes discontinuous, and thus such configuration does not contribute to the path-integral. 

However, this assumption does not hold for QFTs with higher-derivative kinetic terms. Examples of such exotic QFTs (without relativistic symmetry) include tensor gauge theories (refer to [@Pretko:2020cko;@Seiberg:2020bhn] for more details). An example of such kinetic term is $(\partial_t\phi)^2 + (\partial_x\partial_y \phi)^2$. In these theories, a field *can* be discontinuous, but some higher derivatives are constrained to scale appropriately with the ratio of the lattice size to the system size. In such scenarios, the construction of the trivial operator should differ.

These QFTs describe what is known as the **fracton phases** of matter, which do not have emergent continuous rotational symmetry in the IR. Moreover, these models typically possess **subsystem symmetries**, whose corresponding operator is not entirely topological. The existence of this new type of symmetry, absent in standard relativistic systems, could be related to this subtlety regarding identity wall .
:::

Let us study the equations of motion (EOMs) on the right-hand side of @eq-trivial-scalar. The EOM with respect to $\lambda$ simply enforces $\phi_L(x) = \phi_R(x)$ for $x\in W$. On the other hand, the surface term of the Euler-Lagrange equation for $\phi_L$ and $\phi_R$ yields
$$
    \left.\frac{\delta \mathcal{L}[\phi_L]}{\delta \mathop{d\phi_L}}\right|_W = \lambda \vol_W = \left. \frac{\delta \mathcal{L}[\phi_R]}{\delta \mathop{d \phi_R}}\right|_W.
$$
If $W$ is spacelike, or if we interpret the direction perpendicular to $W$ as the imaginary time in Euclidean signature, this condition ensures the continuity of the canonical momentum across $W$.

:::{.callout-note}
#### Locality
@eq-trivial-scalar encapsulates the **locality** of the path-integral. We can employ the same procedure to decompose the path-integral $\int \mathcal{D}^M{\phi}$ on $M$ into path-integrals on local patches, like $\int \prod_i\mathcal{D}^{V_i}\phi_i$ (accompanied by numerous Lagrange multipliers). Here, $\bigcup_i V_i =M$ and $V_i \cap V_j$ has codimension 1 in $M$ if not empty.

In the realm of topological quantum field theory (TQFT), a similar **cutting-and-gluing** axiom is utilized in the Atiyah-Segal formulation of topological quantum field theory. Later, Lurie's cobordism hypothesis [@Lurie] established the relationship between this axiom and locality.

#### A note on fermions
While this lecture does not cover fermions, it's worth noting how they would differ in this context.

In scalar field theory, we enforce the continuity of the "position" variables (in the analytical-mechanical sense) $\phi$, and the continuity of the momentum variables follows from the equations of motion (EOM).

However, in a chiral fermion theory, the kinetic term involves only one derivative, making it typically impossible to separate position and momentum variables while preserving Lorentz or global chiral symmetry.
Consequently, the "cutting" process would seemingly violate invariance under Lorentz or another symmetry, which can be interpreted as a manifestation of the gravitational and global symmetry anomaly.
A precise understanding of this perspective is beyond the scope of this lecture.

## Group Multiplication Law  and Inverse
For the conventional symmetry,
we assume that transformations $g$ forms a group.
Correspondingly, the topological operators should satisfy the same multiplication law: 
$$
U_{g_1}[W_1] U_{g_2}[W_2] = U_{g_1g_2}[W_1]
$${#eq-U-group}
where the codimension-1 submanifold $W_2$ is parralel to $W_1$ but slightly right to it.

To show @eq-U-group, we divide the spacetime into three parts: $M_L,M_M$ and $M_L$, where $W_1$ separates $M_L$ and $M_M$, while $W_2$ separates $M_M$ and $M_R$.




## Symmetry Action and Ward-Takahashi identity

Let us turn to the non-trivial operator @eq-Ug-pathintegral and check the property depicted in @fig-op-action.
In order to do it, start from the correlator where $U_g$ is inserted along $W=W_1$ and the trivial operator $\id$ along $W''=W_2$ in @fig-op-action. (Here we only talk about the equality connecting the leftmost and rightmost figures of @fig-op-action. For the middle one the argument is the same. We also renamed the manifolds for the later convenience.)
Therefore we split the manifold $M$ into three regions $M_L,M_M,M_R$,
and also the field $\phi$ into $\phi_L,\phi_M,\phi_R$.
Then to show the equality in @fig-op-action, we perform the change of the variable $\widetilde{\phi}_M = \phi_M^{g^{-1}}$ :
$$
\begin{align}
    &\langle \mathcal{O}_1 U_g[W_1] \mathcal{O}_2 \rangle = \langle \mathcal{O}_1 U_g[W_1] \mathcal{O}_2 \id[W_2] \rangle \\
     &= \int \prod_{i=L,M,R}\mathop{\mathcal{D}^{M_i}\phi_i} \mathop{\prod_{a=1,2}\mathcal{D}^{W_a} \lambda_a} e^{-S_L[\phi_L]-S_M[\phi_M]-S_R[\phi_R]}\mathcal{O}_1[\phi_L] \mathcal{O}_2[\phi_M]
     \\ 
     &\times \exp\left(-G_{W_1}[\lambda_1,\phi_L,\phi_M,g]-G_{W_2}[\lambda_2,\phi_M,\phi_R,\id]\right)\\
     &= \int \prod_{i=L,M,R}\mathop{\mathcal{D}^{M_i}\phi_i} \mathop{\prod_{a=1,2}\mathcal{D}^{W_a}\lambda_a} e^{-S_L[\phi_L]-S_M[\widetilde\phi_M^g]-S_R[\phi_R]}\mathcal{O}_1[\phi_L] \mathcal{O}_2[\widetilde\phi_M^g]
     \\ 
     &\times \exp\left(-G_{W_1}[\lambda_1,\phi_L,\widetilde\phi_M,\id]-G_{W_2}[\lambda_2,\widetilde{\phi}_M^g,\phi_R,\id]\right)\\ 
     &\times \exp\left( + \int_W s(\phi_L,g) \right)\\ 
     &= \int \prod_{i=L,M,R}\mathop{\mathcal{D}^{M_i}\phi_i} \mathop{\prod_{a=1,2}\mathcal{D}^{W_a}\lambda_a} e^{-S_L[\phi_L]-S_M[\widetilde\phi_M^g]-S_R[\phi_R]}\mathcal{O}_1[\phi_L] \mathcal{O}_2^g[\widetilde\phi_M]
     \\ 
     &\times \exp\left(-G_{W_1}[\lambda_1,\phi_L,\widetilde\phi_M,\id]-G_{-W_2}[\lambda_2,\phi_R,\widetilde{\phi}_M,g^{-1}]\right)\\ 
     &\times \exp\left( + \int_{W_1} s(\phi_M,g) + \int_{W_2} s(\phi_M,g^{-1})  \right)\\
     &= \int \prod_{i=L,M,R}\mathop{\mathcal{D}^{M_i}\phi_i} \mathop{\prod_{a=1,2}\mathcal{D}^{W_a}\lambda_a} e^{-S_L[\phi_L]-S_M[\widetilde\phi_M]-S_R[\phi_R]}\mathcal{O}_1[\phi_L] \mathcal{O}_2^g[\widetilde\phi_M]
     \\ 
     &\times \exp\left(-G_{W_1}[\lambda_1,\phi_L,\widetilde\phi_M,\id]-G_{-W_2}[\lambda_2,\phi_R,\widetilde{\phi}_M,g^{-1}]\right)\\
     &= \langle \mathcal{O}_1 \id[W_1] \mathcal{O}_2 U_{g^{-1}}[-W_2]. \rangle
\end{align}
$$
In the second to last equality we used @eq-Lagrangian-inv and in the last equality we assumed that the path-integral measure is invariant: 
$$\mathcal{D}\phi_M = \mathcal{D}\phi_M^g.
$${#eq-measure-inv}
Lastly, from @eq-delta-functional we get $U_{g^{-1}}[-W] = U_g[W]$, so we obtain @fig-op-action, that is
$$
\langle \mathcal{O}_1 U_g[W_1] \mathcal{O}_2 \rangle = \langle \mathcal{O}_1 \mathcal{O}_2^g U_g[W_2] \rangle.
$${#eq-sym-op-act}

We note that we can also get the following equation in the same way as above:
$$
\langle \mathcal{O}_1 \mathcal{O}_2 \cdots \rangle = \langle U_g[W_0] \mathcal{O}_1 \mathcal{O}_2 \cdots \rangle,
$${#eq-bubble}

when $W_0$ encloses a compact region of $M$ and contains no operator.
Then, by repeatedly using these equations, we get the **Ward-Takahashi identity** :

::: {.callout-important}
#### Ward-Takahashi Identity
$$
\begin{aligned}
\langle \mathcal{O}_1 \mathcal{O}_2 \cdots \mathcal{O}_N \rangle
&= 
\langle U_g[W_0] \mathcal{O}_1 \mathcal{O}_2 \cdots \mathcal{O}_N \rangle\\
&= 
\langle \mathcal{O}_1^g U_g[W_1] \mathcal{O}_2 \cdots \mathcal{O}_N \rangle\\
&= 
\langle \mathcal{O}_1^g  \mathcal{O}_2^g \cdots \mathcal{O}_N^g U_g[W_N] \rangle\\
&= 
\langle \mathcal{O}_1^g  \mathcal{O}_2^g \cdots \mathcal{O}_N^g\rangle,
\end{aligned}
$${#eq-Ward-Takahashi}
where $W_i$ encloses the operators $\mathcal{O}_1 \cdots \mathcal{O}_i$, and at the last step we collapsed $U_g[W_N]$ towards the infinity (or whatever point if $M$ is compact). See also @fig-Ward-Takahashi.

:::

We could get the same result by considering global change of variable $\widetilde{\phi} = \phi^{g^{-1}}$ in the path-integral and could avoid topological operator to derive this identity. 
However, the deriviation in @fig-Ward-Takahashi applies as long as we have a topological operator, and it acts on local operators as in @fig-op-action.
Thus this derivation is applicable to quantum and duality symmetry we will encounter in @sec-compact-boson, and also will be convenient starting point to generalizing the identity to non-invertible case; see @Cordova:2022ieu and @Copetti:2023mcq for example.

Let us quickly recall that Ward-Takahashi identity means selection rules in correlation functions. 
For simplicity, let us consider the $\U(1)$ action:
$$
\mathcal{O}_i^g = g^{q_i}\mathcal{O}_i
$${#eq-WT-U1}
for a phase $g \in \U(1)$. The integer $q_i$ is the $\U(1)$ globalcharge of $\mathcal{O}_i$.
In this case, @eq-Ward-Takahashi reads 
$$ 
\left(1-g^{\sum_i q_i}\right)\left\langle \prod_i \mathcal{O}_i\right\rangle = 0,
$$
for any phase $g \in \U(1)$.
That is, either $\sum_i q_i =0$ --- the total $\U(1)$ charge is saturated --- or that the correlation function vanishes.
This is the familiar selection rule.
If the $\U(1)$ symmetry is broken down to its $\mathbb{Z}_k$ subgroup, @eq-WT-U1 holds only for $g\in \mathbb{Z}_k$. This means the total charge $\sum_i q_i$ should vanish only modulo $k$ for the correlator to be nonzero.

:::{.callout-tip collapse="true"}
#### Mixed-gravitational anomaly
The symmetry we discuss here does not suffer from anomaly and the Ward-Takahashi idendity (@eq-Ward-Takahashi) follows.
If we instead consider the topological operator corresponding to a symmetry with mixed-gravitational anomaly, the invariance of the measure (@eq-measure-inv) does not necessarily hold when $M_M$ does not have the topology of a ball, and likewise @eq-bubble can fail when $W_0$ is not a ball.
Thus, on a spacetime with non-trivial topology (other than $\mathbb{R}^4$ or $S^4$), (@eq-Ward-Takahashi) might fail at the last equality, while (by choosing $W_0$ to be a ball) other steps goes through.
The failure is by a phase depending on topology of the spacetime, and has an interesting consequences of this discussed in [@Cordova:2019jqi].
:::

## Relation to Noether Charge
Here we show the relation @eq-Noether-approx of the topological operator $U_g[W]$ to the conventional Noether charge.
This can be done by applying the change of variable $\widetilde{\phi_R} = \phi^{\id - \alpha f(x_n)}_R$ to @eq-Ug-pathintegral, where $f(x_n,\delta)$ is a function of the coordinate $x_n$ perpendicular to $W$ and one positive parameter $\delta$ and satisfies $f(0) = 1$ and $f(x_n>\delta) =0$.
Then we take $\delta\to 0$ limit and compare.
