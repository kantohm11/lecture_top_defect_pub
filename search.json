Because this lecture will focus on the fundamental aspects of the topic and will not connect very well with the existent literature (so sorry about that), readers/audiences are strongly encouraged to refer to at least one of them, or something similar.\nAlso, about conventional symmetries and their anomalies, there are nice old lectures.

    "section": "1.2 Locality",
    "text": "1.2 Locality\nThe second important keyword in this lecture is locality. By the word quantum field theory, in most cases we implicitly mean local quantum field theory. This can roughly be explained by that the action is written as the integration of Lagrangian density, which is a local functional of fields over the spacetime.\nLocality of QFT has a consequence with respect to symmetry: that is, in most situations we only consider symmetries that preserves locality. In terms of fields, this means that the symmetry transformation is local:\n\\[\n\\phi(x) \\mapsto F(\\phi(x)),\n\\tag{1.2}\\] where \\(F(\\phi(x))\\) is a function depends on the local value a field (or a collection of fields and its derivatives) at the point \\(x\\). If the symmetry involves a spacetime transformation, the point \\(x\\) in the right-hand side should be replaced by the image of \\(x\\) under the symmetry. This preservation of locality of a symmetry is the reason for the symmetry relation in Equation 1.1. This will be made clear in the lecture.\nHowever, not all the (locality-preserving) symmetry in QFT takes the form of Equation 1.2, which is called classical symmetry. There are types of symmetry called topological symmetry or quantum symmetry, which arises from topologically-nontrivial field configuration. Examples are the winding symmetry in 1+1d compact boson, and the monopole symmetries in 2+1d abelian gauge theories. In many occurrences a topological/quantum symmetry is mapped to a symmetry of type of Equation 1.2 under a duality, and thus it should also be considered as being locality-preserving.\nFrom the modern perspective, the universal characterization of locality-preserving symmetries is its correspondence to topological operators. A topological operator \\(\\mathcal{D}[W_n]\\) in a QFT is an extended operator defined on a \\(n\\)-dimensional submanifold of the spacetime and the correlators containing it should be invariant under the smooth deformation of the supporting manifold \\(W_n\\) (See Figure 1.1).\n\n\n\nFigure 1.1: Topological operator.\n\n\nThe first aim of the lecture is to understand the correspondence, that is\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSymmetry/Topological Operator Correspondence\n\n\n\n\\[\\begin{split}\n&\\text{(Conventional) locality-preserving symmetry} \\\\\n&\\Longleftrightarrow\\;\n\\text{invertible topological operator of codimension 1.}\n\\end{split}\n\\tag{1.3}\\]\n\n\nIn this correspondence, the topological operator shoould be regarded as the generalization of the Noether charge into possibly discrete symmetry. To be precise, we regard this correspondence as the right-hand side defining the left-hand side. We will explicitly check this correspondence/definition reproduces the known symmetries in the case of a classical symmetry in a scalar field theory in Chapter 2, and in the case of abelian gauge theory in Chapter 4. The case of fermion is very interesting and crucial, but it will be remained to be worked out by audiences/readers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTerminology (locality-preserving)\n\n\n\n\n\nAgain, we are not talking about gauge redundancy, which is sometimes called local symmetry. Global symmetries one encounters in a QFT textbook are all locality-preserving.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTerminology (topological defect)\n\n\n\n\n\nHere is another unfortunate conflict of terminology. In the literature (outside generalized symmetry literature), a “topological defect” refers to a dynamical object, or its trajectory viewed as an operator in the IR theory, charged under a topological (higher) symmetry. As an operator in the IR theory, it is not a priori guaranteed to be topological in the sense of Figure 1.1 . On the other hand, in the generalized symmetry literature, “topological defect (operator)” often means an extended operator that is itself topological. In this lecture, in order to ease the confusion, we use the term “topological operator”."

That is, we first divide the spacetime \\(M\\) into two parts: \\(M_\\stdim = M_L \\cup_W M_R\\) with shared boundary \\(W\\) (see Figure 2.2. We take the orientation of \\(W\\) so that \\(\\partial M_L = -\\partial M_R = W\\). ). We also separate the scalar field \\(\\phi\\) into two sets of fields: \\(\\phi_L(x)\\) for \\(x \\in M_L\\) and \\(\\phi_R(x)\\) for \\(x \\in M_R\\). Then, we glue the two regions and fields on those back together, with the twisted identification: \\[\n\\phi_L|_W = \\phi_R^{g^{-1}}|_W.\n\\]\n\n\n\nFigure 2.2: The cutting and twisted gluing, implementing the topological operator \\(U_g[W]\\).\n\n\nIn path-integral, this construction can be implemented as follows:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSymmetry Topological Operator\n\n\n\n\\[\n\\begin{multlined}\n    \\langle U_g[W] \\cdots \\rangle = \\int \\mathop{\\mathcal{D}^{M_L}\\phi_L} \\mathop{\\mathcal{D}^{M_R}\\phi_R} \\mathop{\\mathcal{D}^W\\lambda} \\cdots\\\\ \\times \\exp\\left(-S_L[\\phi_L]-S_R[\\phi_R] - G_W[\\lambda,\\phi_L,\\phi_R,g]\\right)\n\\end{multlined}\n\\tag{2.5}\\]\n\n\nHere, \\(\\mathcal{D}^{X}\\) denotes the measure for path-integral for a field defined on a submanifold \\(X\\) of the spacetime \\(M\\), and \\(S_{L,R} = \\int_{M_{L,R}}\\mathcal{L}(\\phi_{L,R})\\) are actions on the submanifold \\(M_{L,R}\\), and “\\(\\cdots\\)” represents additional insertions of operators. In addition, the “gluing” action \\(G_W\\) on the submanifold \\(W\\) is \\[\n\\begin{multlined}\n    G_W[\\lambda,\\phi_L,\\phi_R,g] = - \\imunit \\int_W \\lambda(\\phi_L - \\phi_R^{g^{-1}})\\vol_W+\\int_W s(\\phi_M,g).\n\\end{multlined}\n\\tag{2.6}\\] The heart of the above expression is that integrating the Lagrange multiplier \\(\\lambda\\) out gives the “delta functional”: \\[\n\\\n    \\int \\mathop{\\mathcal{D}^W\\lambda} \\exp\\left(\\imunit \\int_W \\lambda (\\phi_L-\\phi^{g^{-1}}_R)\\vol_W\\right)\n     = \\prod_{x\\in W}\\delta(\\phi_L(x) - \\phi_R^{g^{-1}}(x)),\n\\tag{2.7}\\] which should implement Figure 2.2.

That is, we have \\[\n\\langle \\id[W] \\cdots \\rangle = \\langle \\cdots \\rangle.\n\\tag{2.8}\\] We call the codimension-1 operator \\(\\id[W]\\) with this property identity wall. It can also be called transparent wall or like that. Expanding Equation 2.8, the following equation should hold: \\[\n\\begin{multlined}\n    \\int \\mathop{\\mathcal{D}^M\\phi} \\exp(-S) \\cdots=\n    \\int \\mathop{\\mathcal{D}^{M_L}\\phi_L} \\mathop{\\mathcal{D}^{M_R}\\phi_R} \\mathop{\\mathcal{D}^W\\lambda} \\\\ \\times \\exp\\left(-S_L-S_R+\\imunit \\int_W \\lambda(\\phi_L - \\phi_R)\\vol_W\\right)\\cdots.\\\\\n\\end{multlined}\n\\tag{2.9}\\]\nThe point is that the difference between giving a field \\(\\phi\\) and giving a pair of fields \\((\\phi_L,\\phi_R)\\) is that the latter is not constrained to be continuous across \\(W\\). On the right-hand side it is rather enforced by integrating out \\(\\lambda\\) because of Equation 2.7.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nContinuity of fields in “exotic” QFTs and subsystem symmetry\n\n\n\n\n\nHere we assumed that the path integral \\(\\int\\mathcal{D}^M\\phi\\) should be over the continuous fields. The reason for this is that the standard kinetic term would diverge in the limit where the filed \\(\\phi\\) becomes discontinuous.\nThis assumption, however, does not apply to QFTs with higher-derivative kinetic terms. Examples of such exotic QFTs (without relativistic symmetry) includes tensor gauge theories (see e.g. (Pretko et al. 2020; Seiberg and Shao 2021)). In these theories a field can be discontinuous, but some of higher derivatives are constrained to scale correctly with respect to the ratio of the lattice size and the system size. In such cases the construction of the trivial operator should differ. KO does not know how to describe it because of the UV/IR mixing and totally confused.\nThese QFTs describes what is called the fracton phases of matter, which does not have emergent continuous rotational symmetry in the IR. And the models typically posses subsytemsymmetries, whose corresponding operator is not totally topological. Existence of the new kind of symmetry lacked in standard relativistic systems would be related to the fact that the identy wall looks different from the first place.\n\n\n\nIt is instructive to study the equation of motions (EOMs) on the right hand side of Equation 2.9. The EOM with respect to \\(\\lambda\\) simply states \\(\\phi_L(x) = \\phi_R(x)\\) for \\(x\\in W\\). The surface term of Euler-Lagrange equation for \\(\\phi_L\\) and \\(\\phi_R\\) gives \\[\n    \\left.\\frac{\\delta \\mathcal{L}[\\phi_L]}{\\delta \\mathop{d\\phi_L}}\\right|_W = \\lambda \\vol_W = \\left. \\frac{\\delta \\mathcal{L}[\\phi_R]}{\\delta \\mathop{d \\phi_R}}\\right|_W.\n\\] If \\(W\\) is spacelike, or we regard the direction perpendicular to \\(W\\) as the imaginary time in Euclidean signature, this enforces that the canonical momentum also be continuous across \\(W\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLocality\n\n\n\nEquation 2.9 expresses the locality of the path-integral. We can use the same procedure to decompose the path-integral \\(\\int \\mathcal{D}^M{\\phi}\\) on \\(M\\) into path-integrals on local patches like \\(\\int \\prod_i\\mathcal{D}^{V_i}\\phi_i\\) (comes with many Lagrange multipliers). Here \\(\\bigcup_i V_i =M\\) and \\(V_i \\cap V_j\\) has codimension 1 in \\(M\\) if not empty.\nIndeed, in the context of topological quantum field theory (TQFT), a similar cutting-and-gluing axiom is hired by the Atiyah-Segal formulation of topological quantum field theory and later Lurie’s cobordism hypothesis (Lurie 2008) established the relation between it and the locality.\nAlthough in this lecture we satisfy ourselves with the formal non-rigorous treatment of path-integrals, deeper understanding of locality in non-topological QFT is strongly desired, and there are some promising results e.g. in (Grady and Pavlov 2020).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA comment about fermion\n\n\n\n\n\nBecause we do not plan to talk about fermion in this lecture, we comment on what will differ in the case of fermions.\nIn the scalar field theory, we impose the continuity of the “position” variables (in analytical-mechanical sense) \\(\\phi\\), then the continuity of the momentum variables follows by EOM.\nIn a chiral fermion theory, as its kinetic term involves only one derivative, momentum and position variables cannot typically be possible in a way preserving Lorentz or global chiral symmetry. Thus, the “cutting” have to induce an apparent violation of invariance under the Lorentz or the other symmetry, which is a way of seeing the gravitational and global symmetry anomaly. The precise understanding of this perspective is remained to be open in this lecture (and not in the literature as far as the author knows)."

In order to do it, start from the correlator where \\(U_g\\) is inserted along \\(W=W_1\\) and the trivial operator \\(\\id\\) along \\(W''=W_2\\) in Figure 2.1. (Here we only talk about the equality connecting the leftmost and rightmost figures of Figure 2.1. For the middle one the argument is the same. We also renamed the manifolds for the later convenience.) Therefore we split the manifold \\(M\\) into three regions \\(M_L,M_M,M_R\\), and also the field \\(\\phi\\) into \\(\\phi_L,\\phi_M,\\phi_R\\).

If we instead consider the topological operator corresponding to a symmetry with mixed-gravitational anomaly, the invariance of the measure (Equation 2.10) does not necessarily hold when \\(M_M\\) does not have the topology of a ball, and likewise Equation 2.12 can fail when \\(W_0\\) is not a ball. Thus, on a spacetime with non-trivial topology (other than \\(\\mathbb{R}^4\\) or \\(S^4\\)), (Equation 2.13) might fail at the last equality, while (by choosing \\(W_0\\) to be a ball) other steps goes through. The failure is by a phase depending on topology of the spacetime, and has an interesting consequences of this discussed in (Córdova and Ohmori 2020)."

According to Table 1.1, this topological operator should define a \\(\\U(1)\\) \\(p\\)-form symmetry with \\(p=(\\stdim-2)\\), called the winding symmetry.\nWhat are the operators charged under the symmetry? When \\(p \\ge 1\\) (\\(\\stdim\\ge 3\\)), the operator Equation 3.3 cannot act on a local (point) operator, because the one-dimensional submanifold \\(\\gamma^1\\) can always be deformed one configuration to another without colliding with a point.

    "text": "3.3 Mixed Anomaly between Shift and Winding Symmetry\n\n3.3.1 Intersection\nHaving explicit descriptions of topological operators enables us to directly compute quantum anomaly (often called ’t Hooft anomaly) of the symmetries. This is because, from a modern perspective, the anomaly is a subtlety arises when symmetry operators collide. Here we observe one example of anomaly – the mixed anomaly between the shift and winding symmetry in the compact boson theory – explicitly from the topological operator perspective. For a general theory about anomaly and topological operator, readers can consult other resources, e.g. Tachikawa (2019).\nLet us study the intersection of \\(U_\\alpha^\\text{shift}[W^{\\stdim-1}]\\) (Equation 3.2) and \\(U_\\beta^\\text{winding}[\\gamma^1]\\) (Equation 3.3). FIXME:figure The shift symmetry operator divides \\(\\gamma^1\\) into \\(\\gamma^1_L\\) and \\(\\gamma^1_R\\), and the winding operator thus now, naively, look like \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nU^\\text{shift}_\\alpha U^\\text{winding}_\\beta[\\gamma^1] &\\stackrel{\\text{naive}}{=} U^\\text{shift}_\\alpha \\exp\\left(\\imunit\\beta \\left(\\int_{\\gamma^1_L}\\frac{\\mathop{d\\phi_L}}{2\\pi} + \\int_{\\gamma^1_R}\\frac{\\mathop{d\\phi_R}}{2\\pi}\\right)\\right)\\\\\n& \\sim U^\\text{shift}_\\alpha \\exp\\left(\\imunit\\beta/2\\pi (\\phi_L(x_0) - \\phi_R(x_0)) \\right),\n\\end{aligned}\n\\] where in the second line, \\(\\sim\\) refers to the contribution local to the intersection point \\(x_0\\) (i.e. we ignored the contribution from the other ends of \\(\\gamma^1_L\\) and \\(\\gamma^1_R\\) far from \\(W^{\\stdim-1}\\)). However, the shift symmetry defect enforces \\(\\phi_L = \\phi_R - \\alpha \\mod 2\\pi\\), but the local contribution at \\(x_0\\) depends on \\(\\phi_L-\\phi_R \\mod 2\\pi\\). Therefore the naive definition of intersected operator is not well-defined (or, it becomes zero if we average over the branches of \\(\\phi_L(x_0) -\\phi_R(x_0)\\)).\nA way to define the intersection is to abandon the periodicity of either of \\(\\alpha\\) or \\(\\beta\\). If we regard \\(\\alpha\\) to be in \\(\\mathbb{R}\\) and not \\(\\mathbb{R}/2\\pi\\mathbb{Z}\\), we can modify the above naive definition to be \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nU^\\text{shift}_\\alpha U^\\text{winding}_\\beta[\\gamma^1] &\\stackrel{\\text{def1}}{=} U^\\text{shift}_\\alpha \\exp\\left(\\imunit\\beta \\left(\\int_{\\gamma^1_L}\\frac{\\mathop{d\\phi_L}}{2\\pi} + \\int_{\\gamma^1_R}\\frac{\\mathop{d\\phi_R}}{2\\pi} + \\{\\alpha/2\\pi\\}\\right)\\right)\\\\\n& \\sim U^\\text{shift}_\\alpha \\exp\\left(\\imunit\\beta [\\alpha/2\\pi] \\right),\n\\end{aligned}\n\\] where \\([r]\\) is the integer part of a real number \\(r\\), and \\(\\{r\\}= r-[r]\\). With this definition, or regularization, of the intersection, \\(\\alpha\\) is no longer periodic, but \\(\\beta\\) is kept periodic. One can do other regularizations where \\(\\alpha\\) is periodic but \\(\\beta\\) is not, or just abandon both of periodicity, but cannot save both.\nThis incompatibility of periodicity, or the group multiplication law, when topological operators intersects is the hallmark of anomaly.\n\n\n3.3.2 Group Cohomology\nThe incompatibility above is better characterized as a group cohomology (or its generalization to a higher-group). Here we see how to characterize the mixed anomaly of the compact boson in 1+1d as a group cohomology element. (Here we do not delve into the general theory of group cohomology. See e.g. Tachikawa (2019)).\nIn 1+1d, both \\(U^\\text{shift}_\\alpha\\) and \\(U^\\text{winding}_\\beta\\) are line operators. Both operators are \\(2\\pi\\) periodic in its parameters, when intersection between them are absent. A more precise statement that applies even with intersections is that \\(U^\\text{shift}_\\alpha\\) and \\(U^\\text{shift}_{\\alpha+2\\pi}\\) can be connected with an invertible topological line-changing operator or a line-isomrphism operator for short2 (See also Figure 3.2): \\[\n\\exp\\left(\\frac{\\imunit}{2\\pi} \\int^\\square \\mathop{dV}(\\phi_L-\\phi_R -\\alpha)  + \\imunit V(\\square)  + \\frac{\\imunit}{2\\pi} \\int_\\square \\mathop{dV}(\\phi_L-\\phi_R -\\alpha+2\\pi)  \\right)\n\\] where \\(\\square\\) denotes the point connecting two line operators. Note that the winding operator \\(e^{\\imunit V(\\square)}\\) is precisely cancelled when the integral in the last term is evaluated, and thus the junction operator is topological. The existence of its inverse is also manifest.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.2: Line-isomorphism operators.\n\n\nLikewise, the line isomorphism operator for the winding symmetry operator is \\[\n\\exp\\left(\\imunit \\alpha \\int^{\\triangle} \\frac{d\\phi}{2\\pi} + \\imunit\\phi(\\triangle)  + \\imunit (\\alpha+2\\pi)  \\int_{\\triangle} \\frac{d\\phi}{2\\pi}  \\right).\n\\]\nWe let the composition of the two lines be denoted by \\(U_{\\alpha,\\beta} = U^\\text{shift}_\\alpha U^\\text{winding}_\\beta\\). With it, we can define “naive” junction where two line operators \\(U_{\\alpha_1,\\beta_1}\\) and \\(U_{\\alpha_2,\\beta_2}\\) fusing into \\(U_{\\alpha_1+\\alpha_2,\\beta_1+\\beta_2}\\). However, the fused operator in general has parameters in the fundamental domain other than those of the fused ones. Therefore, we normalize the junction by using the \\(\\square\\) and \\(\\triangle\\) isomorphisms so that the output is \\(U_{\\langle \\alpha_1+\\alpha_2\\rangle, \\langle \\beta_1+\\beta_2\\rangle}\\), where \\(\\langle \\alpha \\rangle = 2\\pi\\{\\alpha/2\\pi\\}\\); see Figure 3.3. The point is that this isomorphism results in a phase when crossing an intersection of the lines.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.3: The definition of junction fusing two \\(U_{\\alpha,\\beta}\\)’s into one.\n\n\nNow, we consider the two consecutive junctions, which fuses three lines \\(U_{\\langle\\alpha_i\\rangle,\\langle\\beta_i\\rangle}\\) (\\(i=1,2,3\\)) into \\(U_{\\langle\\sum_i \\alpha_i\\rangle,\\langle\\sum_j \\beta_j \\rangle}\\); see Figure 3.4.\n\n\n\nFigure 3.4: The anomalous phase from the F-move. We let \\(\\alpha_{12} = \\alpha_1+\\alpha_2\\), etc.\n\n\nThere are two ways of such fusion as depicted in the figure, and the two are related by a nontrivial phase which is \\[\nf(g_1,g_2,g_3) = \\alpha_1\\left[\\frac{\\langle\\beta_2\\rangle}{2\\pi}+\\frac{\\langle\\beta_3\\rangle}{2\\pi}\\right]+\\beta_3\\left[\\frac{\\langle\\alpha_1\\rangle}{2\\pi}+\\frac{\\langle\\alpha_2\\rangle}{2\\pi}\\right],\n\\tag{3.5}\\] where \\(g_i = (\\alpha_i,\\beta_i)\\in U(1)^2\\). The two configurations are gauge-equivalent, yet there is a non-trivial phase relating them. This is the anomalous phase of this anomalous \\(U(1)^2\\) symmetry of 1+1d compact boson.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGroup cohomology\n\n\n\nMathematically speaking, the function \\(f : (U(1)^2)^3 \\to \\mathbb{R}/2\\pi\\mathbb{Z}\\) is a 3-cocycle on the group \\(G=U(1)\\); it satisfies the pentagon identity, depicted in ?fig-pentagon.\nFuther, it is subject to an ambiguity; we can modify the junction by a phase \\(h(g_1,g_2)\\). This modifies the anomalous phase \\(f\\) as \\[ f(g_1,g_2,g_3) \\mapsto f(g_1,g_2,g_3) + (\\delta h)(g_1,g_2,g_3)\n\\] where \\(\\delta h : (U(1))^3\\to \\mathbb{R}/2\\pi\\mathbb{Z}\\) is the following function called a coboundary (FIXME:sign?): \\[\n(\\delta h)(g_1,g_2,g_3) = h(g_1,g_2) + h(g_1g_2,g_3) - h(g_1,g_2g_3) - h(g_2,g_3).\n\\] The third group cohomology is an element of the quatient group \\[\nH^3 = \\{f\\in\\Map(G^3,\\mathbb{R}/2\\pi\\mathbb{Z})\\mid\\text{pentagon eq.}\\} / \\delta(\\Map(G^3,\\mathbb{R}/2\\pi\\mathbb{Z})),\n\\] where \\(\\Map(X,Y)\\) is the abelian group of \\(Y\\) valued functions on \\(X\\) 3. This group cohomology classifies the anomalous phases of 1+1-dimensional bosonic theories with \\(G\\)-symmetry.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise: \\(\\mathbb{Z}_2\\) anomaly\n\n\n\nThe diagonal \\(\\mathbb{Z}_3\\) subgroup of \\(U(1)^2\\) generate by \\(U_{2\\pi/3,2\\pi/3}\\) is anomalous. Confirm this fact by calculating \\(f(g_1,g_2,g_3)\\) for \\(g_i\\)’s in this subgroup, and also proving that no \\(h\\) can satisfy \\(f = -\\delta(h)\\). Optionally one might consider some other finite subgroups of \\(U(1)^2\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComparison to more conventional calculation.\n\n\n\nThe mixed anomaly between the shift and winding symmetry in 1+1d compact boson is usually computed from the two-point function of the corresponding current operators. Such computation corresopnds to non-flat and infinitesimal background for the symmetries. On the other hand, inserting topological operator corresponds to flat and finite background. The two computations results in the same result is quite non-trivial, and is explained by the Chern-Weil theory.\nWhile the computation based on non-flat background is easier, it is only for continuous symmetries and not obvious how it restricts to a finite subgroup, for example."

    "text": "3.4 T-duality\nThe compact boson in \\(\\stdim=2\\)-dimensions famously has T-duality.\nThe T-duality is equivalence between the compact boson with radius \\(R\\) and radius \\(\\frac{1}{R}\\), and maps the shift (or momentum) symmetry of one side to the winding symmetry of the other side, and vise versa. Note that this makes sense because in \\(\\stdim=2\\) the winding symmetry is a 0-form symmetry.\nWhen the radius is the self-dual radius \\(R=1\\), the duality becomes a (conventional) \\(\\mathbb{Z}_2\\) symmetry, which is a part of the larger emergent \\(\\SU(2)\\) symmetry.\nIn this section we study\n\nthe explicit construction of the T-duality topological interface connecting radius \\(R\\) and \\(1/R\\) theories (Kapustin and Tikhonov 2009), and\nits generalization giving non-invertible symmetry (i.e. self-dual topological interface) at \\(R=\\sqrt{N}\\) for an integer \\(N\\).\n\nThe latter can further be generalized to the case of rational \\(R^2\\) (Cordova and Ohmori 2023; Niro et al. 2023).\n\n3.4.1 T-duality topological interface\nHere we study the T-duality topological interface connecting two compact boson theories in \\(\\stdim=2\\)-dimensions; with radius \\(R\\) and radius \\(1/R\\). FIXME:figure! When \\(R=1\\), the interface is a topological operator within the same thoery, and thus defines a symmetry. In this case it turns out a \\(\\mathbb{Z}_2\\) symmetry, known to be contained in the larger \\(\\SU(2)\\) enhanced symmetry.\nAccording to (Kapustin and Tikhonov 2009), the partition functino involving the interface is \\[\n\\begin{multlined}\n\\langle \\mathcal{O}_L \\mathcal{I}^\\text{T}_1[W] \\mathcal{O}_R  \\rangle=\n\\int \\mathop{\\mathcal{D}^{M_L}\\phi_L}\\mathop{\\mathcal{D}^{M_R}\\phi_R}\n\\mathcal{O}_L[\\phi_L]\\mathcal{O}_R[\\phi_R]\\\\\n\\exp\\left(-\\frac{R^2}{4\\pi}\\int_{M_L}\\mathop{d\\phi_L}*\\mathop{d\\phi_L}\n-\\frac{\\imunit}{2\\pi}\\int_W \\phi_L\\mathop{d\\phi_R}\n-\\frac{1}{4\\pi R^2}\\int_{M_R}\\mathop{d\\phi_R}*\\mathop{d\\phi_R}\\right).\n\\end{multlined}\n\\tag{3.6}\\] For simplicity let us take \\(\\mathcal{O}_R =1\\), and \\(M_R\\) be a compact region in the spacetime. In this case, we expect the supposed topological-ness implies \\[\n\\langle \\mathcal{O}_L \\mathcal{I}_1^\\text{T}[W]\\rangle = \\langle \\mathcal{O}_L \\rangle.\n\\] To show this, we replace the variable \\(\\phi_R\\) with \\(F_R = d\\phi_R\\) by \\[\n\\int \\mathcal{D}\\phi_R = \\int \\mathop{\\mathcal{D}F_R} \\mathop{\\mathcal{D}\\widetilde{\\phi}_R}\n\\exp\\left(\\frac{\\imunit}{2\\pi} \\int_{M_R}\\widetilde{\\phi}_R \\mathop{dF_R}\\right),\n\\] where the periodic scalar \\(\\widetilde{\\phi}_R\\) is the Lagrange multiplier enforcing the closedness and the quantization of \\(F_R = d\\phi_R\\). Substituting this into Equation 3.6, the EOMs with respect to \\(F_R\\) are \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n    \\frac{1}{R} *d\\phi_R(x) &= \\imunit d\\widetilde\\phi_R(x) \\quad \\mathop{\\text{for}} x \\in M_R \\\\\n    \\phi_L(x) &= \\widetilde{\\phi}_R(x) \\quad \\mathop{\\text{for}} x \\in W.\n\\end{aligned}\n\\tag{3.7}\\] Substituting the former equation to the Lagrangea of \\(\\phi_R\\), we get \\[\n    \\frac{R^2}{4\\pi} \\int_{M_R}\\mathop{d\\widetilde{\\phi}_R}*\\mathop{d\\widetilde{\\phi}_R}\n\\] with is the same as for \\(\\phi_L\\), while the latter of Equation 3.7 connects \\(\\phi_L\\) and \\(\\widetilde{\\phi}_R\\) along \\(W\\). As a whole, we recover the path-integral over \\(M\\) resulting in \\(\\langle \\mathcal{O}_L \\rangle\\). For a more general topological-ness about local deformation of \\(W\\) can be derived in the same way but with more letters.\nNow, let us set \\(\\mathcal{O}_R = \\mathcal{O}^\\text{winding}_n(x)\\) and see how the topological interface acts on the operator. As the operator \\(\\mathcal{O}^\\text{winding}_n\\) in Equation 3.4 is defined on the trivial surface operator, we have to divide the manifold into three parts: \\(M_L,M_M,m_R\\), separated by \\(W_1\\) and \\(W_2\\). As the \\(M_L\\) and field on it is not going to be relevant, we suppress them in the following equations. The calculation goes as:\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\mathcal{I}_1^\\text{T} \\mathcal{O}^\\text{winding}_n(x)\n&= \\int \\mathop{\\mathcal{D}\\phi_M}\\mathop{\\mathcal{D}\\phi_R}\\mathop{\\mathcal{D}^{W_2}V}\n\\exp\\left(-S_M^{1/R}-S_R^{1/R}-\\frac{\\imunit}{2\\pi}\\int_{W_1}\\phi_L \\mathop{d\\phi_M}\\right)\\\\\n&\\times\\exp\\left(\\frac{\\imunit}{2\\pi}\\int_{W_2}\\mathop{dV}(\\phi_M-\\phi_R) + \\imunit n V(x) \\right)\\\\\n&= \\int \\mathop{\\mathcal{D}F_M}\\mathop{\\mathcal{D}F_R}\\mathop{\\mathcal{D}^{W_2}V}\\mathop{\\mathcal{D}\\widetilde\\phi_M}\\mathop{\\mathcal{D}\\widetilde\\phi_R}\\\\\n&\\times\\exp\\left(-S_M^{1/R}-S_R^{1/R}-\\frac{\\imunit}{2\\pi}(\\int_{W_1}\\phi_L \\mathop{d\\phi_M}-\\int_{M_M}\\tilde{\\phi}_M\\mathop{dF_M} - \\int_{M_R}\\tilde{\\phi}_R\\mathop{dF_R})\\right)\\\\\n&\\times\\exp\\left(+\\frac{\\imunit}{2\\pi}\\int_{W_2}\\mathop{V}(F_M-F_R) + \\imunit n V(x) \\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n\\] Now, the EOMs in terms of \\(F_M\\) and \\(F_R\\) state \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n    \\frac{1}{R} *d\\phi_{M,R} &= \\imunit d\\widetilde\\phi_{M,R}(x) \\quad \\text{on} \\;\\; M_{M,R}, \\\\\n    \\phi_L &= \\widetilde{\\phi}_M \\quad \\text{on} \\;\\; W_1,\\\\\n\\tilde{\\phi}_M &= V = \\tilde{\\phi}_R \\quad \\text{on} \\;\\; W_2.\n\\end{aligned}\n\\] Thus by substituting back we get FIXME:check the sign! \\[\n\\mathcal{I}_1^\\text{T}\\cdots\\mathcal{O}_n^\\text{winding} = \\mathcal{O}_{\\pm? n}^\\text{shift}.\n\\]\nIn addition, let us calculate \\((\\mathcal{I}_1[W]^\\text{T})^2\\). For this, we insert the defects along parallel submanifolds \\(W_1\\) and \\(W_2\\) and take the limit where the separation of the two shrinks. FIXME:figure This can be calculated as \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\mathcal{I}_1^\\text{T}[W_1]\\mathcal{I}_1^\\text{T}[W_2]\n&= \\int \\mathcal{D}^{M_M}\\phi_M \\exp(-\\imunit \\int_{W_1} \\phi_L d\\phi_M - \\imunit\\int_{W_2} \\phi_M d\\phi_R)\\\\\n&= \\int \\mathcal{D}^{W}\\phi_M \\exp(-\\imunit \\int_{W} (\\phi_L - \\phi_R) d\\phi_M)\\\\\n&= \\id[W],\n\\end{aligned}\n\\] where in the second line we collide \\(W_1\\) and \\(W_2\\), and noted that only the mode of \\(\\phi_M\\) constant along the direction perpendicular to \\(W_1\\) and \\(W_2\\) contributes. Therefore, the T-duality interface squares to the identity. In particular, at \\(R=1\\), the self-interface defines an invertible \\(\\mathbb{Z}_2\\) symmetry.\n\n\n3.4.2 Non-invertible symmetry from T-duality\nChoi et al. (2022) generalized the Kapustin-Tikhonov T-duality interface by Kapustin and Tikhonov (2009) as \\[\n\\begin{multlined}\n\\langle \\mathcal{O}_L \\mathcal{I}^\\text{T}_N[W] \\mathcal{O}_R  \\rangle=\n\\int \\mathop{\\mathcal{D}^{M_L}\\phi_L}\\mathop{\\mathcal{D}^{M_R}\\phi_R}\n\\mathcal{O}_L[\\phi_L]\\mathcal{O}_R[\\phi_R]\\\\\n\\exp\\left(-\\frac{R^2}{4\\pi}\\int_{M_L}\\mathop{d\\phi_L}*\\mathop{d\\phi_L}\n-\\frac{\\imunit N}{2\\pi}\\int_W \\phi_L\\mathop{d\\phi_R}\n-\\frac{N^2}{4\\pi R^2}\\int_{M_R}\\mathop{d\\phi_R}*\\mathop{d\\phi_R}\\right).\n\\end{multlined}\n\\tag{3.8}\\] This interface is a self-interface at \\(R=\\sqrt{N}\\). The same procedure as we did for \\(\\mathcal{I}_1\\) leads to \\[\n\\begin{multlined}\n\\langle\\mathcal{O}_L \\mathcal{I}^\\text{T}_N[W] \\rangle=\n\\int \\mathop{\\mathcal{D}^{M_L}\\phi_L}\\mathop{\\mathcal{D}^{M_R}\\phi_R}\\mathop{\\mathcal{D}^{W}V'}\n\\mathcal{O}_L[\\phi_L]\\\\\n\\exp\\left(-\\frac{R^2}{4\\pi}\\int_{M_L}\\mathop{d\\phi_L}*\\mathop{d\\phi_L}\n-\\frac{\\imunit }{2\\pi}\\int_W (N \\phi_L - \\widetilde{\\phi}_R)\\mathop{dV}\n-\\frac{R^2}{4\\pi N^2}\\int_{M_R}\\mathop{d\\widetilde\\phi_R}*\\mathop{d\\widetilde\\phi_R}\\right).\n\\end{multlined}\n\\tag{3.9}\\] We further rescale the fields as\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nV' &= NV \\\\\nN \\widetilde\\phi_R' &= \\widetilde\\phi_R \\mod 2\\pi\n\\end{aligned}\n\\] so that we have \\[\n\\begin{multlined}\n\\langle\\mathcal{O}_L \\mathcal{I}^\\text{T}_N[W] \\rangle = \\mathcal{N}\n\\int \\mathop{\\mathcal{D}^{M_L}\\phi_L}\\mathop{\\mathcal{D}^{M_R}\\phi_R}\\mathop{\\mathcal{D}^{W}V'}\n\\mathcal{O}_L[\\phi_L]\\\\\n\\exp\\left(-\\frac{R^2}{4\\pi}\\int_{M_L}\\mathop{d\\phi_L}*\\mathop{d\\phi_L}\n-\\frac{\\imunit }{2\\pi}\\int_W ( \\phi_L - \\widetilde{\\phi}_R')\\mathop{dV'}\n-\\frac{R^2}{4\\pi}\\int_{M_R}\\mathop{d\\widetilde\\phi_R'}*\\mathop{d\\widetilde\\phi_R'}\\right).\n\\end{multlined}\n\\tag{3.10}\\] To go from Equation 3.10 to Equation 3.9, we define a \\(\\mathbb{Z}_N\\) valued variable \\(n_{\\widetilde{\\phi'}_R} = [N\\widetilde{\\phi'}_R/2\\pi] \\mod N\\) so that \\(\\widetilde{\\phi'} = \\frac{2\\pi}{N}(\\{\\widetilde{\\phi}/2\\pi\\} + 2\\pi n_{\\widetilde{\\phi'}_R})\\). Then, after substituting it, the sum over \\(n_{\\widetilde{\\phi'}}\\) enforces \\(V'\\) be divisible by \\(N\\) (that is, the winding of \\(V\\) along \\(W\\) is constrained to be a multiple of \\(N\\)). Thus, we have \\[\\langle\\mathcal{O}_L \\mathcal{I}_N^\\text{T}[W]\\rangle = \\mathcal{N} \\langle \\mathcal{O}_L \\rangle.\n\\] We are not caring enough about the absolute size of path-integral measure to determine the normalization constant \\(\\mathcal{N}\\), but will determined in by another mean later.\n\n3.4.2.1 Fusion rule\nThe product, or fusion of the generalized operator is \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n(\\mathcal{I}_N^\\text{T})^2 &= \\int \\mathcal{D}^W V \\exp(\\frac{\\imunit}{2\\pi} N \\int_W \\mathop{dV}(\\phi_L-\\phi_R))\\\\\n&= \\sum_{n=0}^{N-1} \\int \\mathcal{D}^W V' \\exp(\\frac{\\imunit}{2\\pi}  \\int_W \\mathop{dV}(\\phi_L-\\phi_R+ 2\\pi n/N))\\\\\n&= \\sum_{n=0}^{N-1} U_{2\\pi n/N}^{\\text{shift}},\n\\end{aligned}\n\\tag{3.11}\\] where in the second line we did the chage of variable \\(NV = V'\\), and enforced the divisibility of \\(V'\\) by \\(N\\) by the sum over \\(n\\). One can also see \\(\\mathcal{I}_N^\\text{T}[-W] = \\mathcal{I}_N^\\text{T}[W]\\) (note that when we consider an operator on \\(W\\) the notion of “left” and “right” also flips), so \\[\n\\mathcal{I}_N^\\text{T}[W]\\mathcal{I}_N^\\text{T}[-W] = \\sum_{n=0}^{N-1} U_{2\\pi n/N}^{\\text{shift}}.\n\\] This contrasts to the case of conventional symmetry operator, where \\(U_g[W] = U_{g^{-1}}[W]\\) and thus \\[\nU_g [W] U_g[-W] = \\id[W].\n\\] In the case of \\(\\mathcal{I}_N^\\text{T}\\), \\(N\\ge 2\\), the fusion with its orientation reversal is not the trivial operator, but a sum. This is a one of hallmarks of non-invertible symmetry. \\(\\mathcal{I}_N^\\text{T}[-W]\\), called the dual of the original operator, is the closest possible thing to be the “inverse”, but it fails to be so. Therefore, the compact boson theory in 1+1d at \\(R=\\sqrt{N}\\) has the non-invertible T-duality symmetry.\nHere, we can determine that the coefficient in the above equations are correct. This is because that we can insert the one-dimensional operator \\((\\mathcal{I}_N^\\text{T})^2\\) along the time direction, which should determine the defect Hilbert space. On the right hand side, we should have a direct sum of defect Hilbert spaces for the involved invertible symmetry operators. There is no way to take “average” over Hilbert spaces, or divide it by a number, so we can assume the minimal possible coefficient is realized, which is the one in Equation 3.11.\nGiven Equation 3.11, the coefficient \\(\\mathcal{N}\\) in Equation 3.10 is determined by \\[\n\\langle (\\mathcal{I}_N^\\text{T})^2[W] \\rangle = \\sum_{n=0}^{N-1}\\langle U_{2\\pi n/N}^\\text{shift}[W] \\rangle = \\mathcal{N}^2,\n\\] thus \\(\\mathcal{N} = \\sqrt{N}\\). This quantity is called the quantum dimension of \\(\\mathcal{I}_N^\\text{T}\\).\n\n\n3.4.2.2 Action on the local operators\nWhat is the action of \\(\\mathcal{I}_N^\\text{T}\\) on the local operator \\(\\mathcal{O}^\\text{winding}_n\\)? Naively repeating the procedure in the previous section, one might think \\[\n\\mathcal{I}_N^\\text{T} \\cdot \\mathcal{O}^\\text{winding}_n(x) \\stackrel{?}{=} \\mathcal{O}^\\text{shift}_{n/N}(x)\n\\] however the left hand side, \\(e^{\\imunit n/N \\phi}\\), does not make sense when \\(N\\) does not divide \\(n\\) as it is incompatible with the periodicity of \\(\\phi\\). Thus the right hand side vanishes unless \\(N | n\\), and we have \\[\n\\mathcal{I}_N^\\text{T} \\cdot \\mathcal{O}^\\text{winding}_n(x) =\n\\begin{cases}\ne^{\\imunit \\frac{n}{N}\\phi} & N|n \\\\\n0 & \\text{otherwise}.\n\\end{cases}\n\\] Note that here we considered the encircling action (FIXME:Figure!!). We can instead consider the passing action, in which case we have \\[\n\\mathcal{I}_N^\\text{T}[W_L]  \\mathcal{O}^\\text{winding}_n(x) =\ne^{\\imunit \\frac{n}{N}\\int_{\\gamma^x} \\mathop{d\\phi}} \\mathcal{I}_N^\\text{T}[W_R],\n\\] \\(W_{L,R}\\) goes through the left/right side of the point \\(x\\), and the path \\(\\gamma^x\\) starts from a point on \\(W_R\\) and ends at \\(x\\).\n\n\n\n3.4.3 Non-invertible T-duality for a rational \\(R\\)\nWe can further generalize Equation 3.8 so that it is a self duality at \\(R^2 = p/q\\) (\\(p\\) and \\(q\\) are taken to be coprime) (Cordova and Ohmori 2023; Niro et al. 2023). The construction is \\[\n\\mathcal{I}_{p,q}^\\text{T}[W]=\\int \\mathop{\\mathcal{D}^W a} \\mathop{\\mathcal{D}^W b} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\imunit}{2\\pi}  \\int_W (q \\mathop{a} \\mathop{db} +p \\mathop{a} \\mathop{d\\phi_L} - b \\mathop{d\\phi_R} )\\right),\n\\] where \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are periodic scalar fields on \\(W\\). The fusion is \\[\n(\\mathcal{I}_{p,q}^\\text{T}[W])^2 = \\sum_{n_1=0}^{p-1}\\sum_{n_2=0}^{q-1}U^\\text{shift}_{2\\pi n_1/N}U^\\text{winding}_{2\\pi n_2/N},\n\\] and the quantum dimension is \\[\n\\langle \\mathcal{I}_{p,q}^\\text{T}[W]\\rangle = \\sqrt{pq}.\n\\]\n\n\n\n\nChoi, Y., Cordova, C., Hsin, P.-S., Lam, H.
