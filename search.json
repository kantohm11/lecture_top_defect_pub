Because this lecture will focus on the fundamental aspects of the topic and will not connect very well with the existent literature (so sorry about that), readers/audiences are strongly encouraged to refer to at least one of them, or something similar.\nAlso, about conventional symmetries and their anomalies, there are nice old lectures.

    "section": "1.2 Locality",
    "text": "1.2 Locality\nOne of the defining characteristics of symmetry in quantum field theories (QFTs) is its preservation of locality. In the context of classical symmetry in fields, this means that the symmetry transformation is local:\n\\[\n\\phi(x) \\mapsto F(\\phi(x')),\n\\tag{1.3}\\]\nIn this equation, \\(F(\\phi(x'))\\) is a function that relies solely on the local value of a field (or a set of fields and its derivatives) at a point \\(x'\\). When \\(x'\\neq x\\), the symmetry involves a spacetime symmetry, while when \\(x'=x\\), it is an internal symmetry. The preservation of locality in a symmetry underpins the symmetry relation in Equation 1.2, which will be elaborated further in the lecture.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nPlease note that a QFT, when quantized on a fixed space manifold \\(M\\), does possess unitary operators that commute with its Hamiltonian, other than those originating from locality-preserving symmetry. In most cases, such unitary operators are irrelevant; an example is the one that multiplies a phase to a specific eigenstate. Therefore, in this lecture, when we refer to a symmetry, we assume that it preserves locality. In fact, we assert that this property is the last one to be discarded in the context of generalized symmetry, if ever, due to the invariance under the renormalization group flow. 1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTerminology (Locality-Preserving)\n\n\n\n\n\nTo avoid confusion, it’s important to note that locality-preserving symmetry does not mean gauge redundancy, which is sometimes labeled as local symmetry. The global – spacetime, or internal – symmetries typically encountered in a QFT textbook all preserve locality.\n\n\n\nHowever, not all symmetries in QFT that preserve locality take the form of Equation 1.3, i.e., a classical symmetry. Other types of symmetries exist, such as topological symmetry or quantum symmetry, which emerge from topologically nontrivial field configurations. Examples include the winding symmetry in 1+1d compact boson, and the monopole symmetries in 2+1d abelian gauge theories. In many cases, a topological/quantum symmetry is mapped to a symmetry of the type Equation 1.3 under a duality, and thus it should also be considered as preserving locality.\nFrom a contemporary standpoint, the universal characterization of locality-preserving symmetries is their correspondence to topological operators. A topological operator \\(\\mathcal{D}[W_n]\\) in a QFT is an extended operator defined on an \\(n\\)-dimensional submanifold of the spacetime. The correlators that include it should remain invariant under the smooth deformation of the supporting manifold \\(W_n\\) (See Figure 1.1).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.1: Topological operator.\n\n\n\nThe first goal of this lecture is to understand the following correspondence:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSymmetry/Topological Operator Correspondence\n\n\n\n\\[\\begin{split}\n&\\text{(Conventional) locality-preserving symmetry} \\\\\n&\\Longleftrightarrow\\;\n\\text{invertible topological operator of codimension 1.}\n\\end{split}\n\\tag{1.4}\\]\n\n\nIn this correspondence, the topological operator should be viewed as a generalization of the Noether charge for potentially discrete symmetry. More precisely, we consider this correspondence as the right-hand side defining the left-hand side. We will explicitly verify that this correspondence/definition reproduces the known symmetries in the case of a classical symmetry in a scalar field theory in Chapter 2, and in the case of abelian gauge theory in Chapter 4. The case of fermions is both intriguing and crucial, but it will be left as an exercise, or a work, for the audience/readers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTerminology (Topological Defect)\n\n\n\n\n\nThere exists an unfortunate discrepancy in terminology. Outside the realm of generalized symmetry literature, a “topological defect” typically refers to a dynamical object, or its trajectory, viewed as an operator in the IR theory. As an operator in the IR theory, it is not necessarily topological in the sense of Figure 1.1. Conversely, within the generalized symmetry literature, “topological defect (operator)” often signifies an extended operator that is inherently topological. To mitigate potential confusion in this lecture, we will adopt the term “topological operator”, even when the supporting submanifold of the operator is not within a time-slice.",

    "text": "1.3 Generalized Symmetry\nThe concept of generalized (global) symmetry is fundamentally based on the correspondence in Equation 1.4, as introduced by (Gaiotto et al. 2015) 2. This concept expands the traditional notion of symmetry by loosening the constraints on the right-hand side of Equation 1.4. Hence, we define generalized symmetry through the following correspondence, which extends Equation 1.4:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGeneralized Symmetry/Topological Operator Correspondence\n\n\n\n\\[\\begin{split}\n&\\text{Generalized symmetry (in a ``usual\" QFT)} \\\\\n&\\stackrel{\\text{def}}{\\Longleftrightarrow}\\;\n\\text{General topological operator.}\n\\end{split}\n\\tag{1.5}\\]\n\n\nIn more specific terms, a generalized symmetry that corresponds to an operator of codimension \\(p+1\\) is referred to as a \\(p\\)-form symmetry. Meanwhile, a generalized symmetry that corresponds to an operator without an inverse is known as a non-invertible symmetry (also referred to as category symmetry or topological symmetry).\nIn the context of an “unusual” QFT, the topological constraint on the operator in the right-hand side of Equation 1.5 can be further relaxed. This leads to the concept of subsystem symmetry, which will be briefly mentioned in ?sec-trivial-scalar, but will not be discussed in detail in this lecture.\nThe table below summarizes the subclasses of generalized symmetry:\n\n\n\nTable 1.1: Subclasses of generalized symmetry and defining properties of their corresponding topological operators.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\(p\\)-form\nnon-invertible\nsubsystem\n\n\n\n\ncodimension\n\\(p+1\\)\n\n\n\n\nInvertible?\n\nNo\n\n\n\nTopological?\n\n\nPartially\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThese subclasses are not mutually exclusive.

Initially, we partition the spacetime \\(M\\) into two subregions: \\(M_\\stdim = M_L \\cup_W M_R\\) with a common boundary \\(W\\) (refer to Figure 2.2. We orient \\(W\\) such that \\(\\partial M_L = -\\partial M_R = W\\).). We also divide the scalar field \\(\\phi\\) into two fields: \\(\\phi_L(x)\\) for \\(x \\in M_L\\) and \\(\\phi_R(x)\\) for \\(x \\in M_R\\). Subsequently, we reconnect the two regions and their respective fields, with a twisted identification: \\[ \\phi_L|_W = \\phi_R^{g^{-1}}|_W. \\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.2: The cutting and twisted gluing, implementing the topological operator \\(U_g[W]\\).\n\n\n\nIn path-integral, this construction can be implemented as follows:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSymmetry Topological Operator for a Classical Symmetry\n\n\n\n\\[\n\\begin{multlined}\n    \\langle U_g[W] \\cdots \\rangle = \\int \\mathop{\\mathcal{D}^{M_L}\\phi_L} \\mathop{\\mathcal{D}^{M_R}\\phi_R} \\mathop{\\mathcal{D}^W\\lambda} \\cdots\\\\ \\times \\exp\\left(-S_L[\\phi_L]-S_R[\\phi_R] - G_W[\\lambda,\\phi_L,\\phi_R,g]\\right)\n\\end{multlined}\n\\tag{2.7}\\]\n\n\nHere, \\(\\mathcal{D}^{X}\\) denotes the measure for the path-integral for a field defined on a submanifold \\(X\\) of the spacetime \\(M\\).

It can also be termed as the transparent wall or similar. Upon expanding Equation 2.10, the following equation should be satisfied: \\[\n\\begin{multlined}\n    \\int \\mathop{\\mathcal{D}^M\\phi} \\exp(-S) \\cdots=\n    \\int \\mathop{\\mathcal{D}^{M_L}\\phi_L} \\mathop{\\mathcal{D}^{M_R}\\phi_R} \\mathop{\\mathcal{D}^W\\lambda} \\\\ \\times \\exp\\left(-S_L-S_R+\\imunit \\int_W \\lambda(\\phi_L - \\phi_R)\\vol_W\\right)\\cdots.\\\\\n\\end{multlined}\n\\tag{2.11}\\]\nThe key distinction between providing a field \\(\\phi\\) on \\(M\\) and providing a pair of fields \\((\\phi_L,\\phi_R)\\) on \\((M_L,M_R)\\) is that the latter is not required to be continuous across \\(W\\). On the right-hand side, continuity is enforced by integrating out \\(\\lambda\\) due to Equation 2.9.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip 2.1: Continuity of Fields in “Exotic” QFTs and Subsystem Symmetry\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this context, we assume that the path integral \\(\\int\\mathcal{D}^M\\phi\\) should be over the continuous fields. This is because the standard kinetic term would diverge when the field \\(\\phi\\) becomes discontinuous, and thus such configuration does not contribute to the path-integral.\nHowever, this assumption does not hold for QFTs with higher-derivative kinetic terms. Examples of such exotic QFTs (without relativistic symmetry) include tensor gauge theories (refer to (Pretko et al. 2020; Seiberg and Shao 2021) for more details). An example of such kinetic term is \\((\\partial_t\\phi)^2 + (\\partial_x\\partial_y \\phi)^2\\). In these theories, a field can be discontinuous, but some higher derivatives are constrained to scale appropriately with the ratio of the lattice size to the system size. In such scenarios, the construction of the trivial operator should differ.\nThese QFTs describe what is known as the fracton phases of matter, which do not have emergent continuous rotational symmetry in the IR. Moreover, these models typically possess subsystem symmetries, whose corresponding operator is not entirely topological. The existence of this new type of symmetry, absent in standard relativistic systems, could be related to this subtlety regarding identity wall .\n\n\n\nLet us study the equations of motion (EOMs) on the right-hand side of Equation 2.11. The EOM with respect to \\(\\lambda\\) simply enforces \\(\\phi_L(x) = \\phi_R(x)\\) for \\(x\\in W\\). On the other hand, the surface term of the Euler-Lagrange equation for \\(\\phi_L\\) and \\(\\phi_R\\) yields \\[\n    \\left.\\frac{\\delta \\mathcal{L}[\\phi_L]}{\\delta \\mathop{d\\phi_L}}\\right|_W = \\lambda \\vol_W = \\left. \\frac{\\delta \\mathcal{L}[\\phi_R]}{\\delta \\mathop{d \\phi_R}}\\right|_W.\n\\] If \\(W\\) is spacelike, or if we interpret the direction perpendicular to \\(W\\) as the imaginary time in Euclidean signature, this condition ensures the continuity of the canonical momentum across \\(W\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLocality\n\n\n\nEquation 2.11 encapsulates the locality of the path-integral. We can employ the same procedure to decompose the path-integral \\(\\int \\mathcal{D}^M{\\phi}\\) on \\(M\\) into path-integrals on local patches, like \\(\\int \\prod_i\\mathcal{D}^{V_i}\\phi_i\\) (accompanied by numerous Lagrange multipliers). Here, \\(\\bigcup_i V_i =M\\) and \\(V_i \\cap V_j\\) has codimension 1 in \\(M\\) if not empty.\nIn the realm of topological quantum field theory (TQFT), a similar cutting-and-gluing axiom is utilized in the Atiyah-Segal formulation of topological quantum field theory. Later, Lurie’s cobordism hypothesis (Lurie 2008) established the relationship between this axiom and locality.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA note on fermions\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile this lecture does not cover fermions, it’s worth noting how they would differ in this context.\nIn scalar field theory, we enforce the continuity of the “position” variables (in the analytical-mechanical sense) \\(\\phi\\), and the continuity of the momentum variables follows from the equations of motion (EOM).\nHowever, in a chiral fermion theory, the kinetic term involves only one derivative, making it typically impossible to separate position and momentum variables while preserving Lorentz or global chiral symmetry. Consequently, the “cutting” process would seemingly violate invariance under Lorentz or another symmetry, which can be interpreted as a manifestation of the gravitational and global symmetry anomaly. A precise understanding of this perspective is beyond the scope of this lecture.",

See also Figure 2.3.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.3: Derivation of Ward-Takahashi identity Equation 2.18.\n\n\n\nWe could get the same result by considering global change of variable \\(\\widetilde{\\phi} = \\phi^{g^{-1}}\\) in the path-integral and could avoid topological operator to derive this identity. However, the deriviation in Figure 2.3 applies as long as we have a topological operator, and it acts on local operators as in Figure 2.1. Thus this derivation is applicable to quantum and duality symmetry we will encounter in Chapter 3, and also will be convenient starting point to generalizing the identity to non-invertible case; see Cordova and Ohmori (2023) and Copetti et al. (2023) for example.\nLet us quickly recall that Ward-Takahashi identity means selection rules in correlation functions. For simplicity, let us consider the \\(\\U(1)\\) action: \\[\n\\mathcal{O}_i^g = g^{q_i}\\mathcal{O}_i\n\\tag{2.19}\\] for a phase \\(g \\in \\U(1)\\). The integer \\(q_i\\) is the \\(\\U(1)\\) globalcharge of \\(\\mathcal{O}_i\\). In this case, Equation 2.18 reads \\[\n\\left(1-g^{\\sum_i q_i}\\right)\\left\\langle \\prod_i \\mathcal{O}_i\\right\\rangle = 0,\n\\] for any phase \\(g \\in \\U(1)\\). That is, either \\(\\sum_i q_i =0\\) — the total \\(\\U(1)\\) charge is saturated — or that the correlation function vanishes. This is the familiar selection rule. If the \\(\\U(1)\\) symmetry is broken down to its \\(\\mathbb{Z}_k\\) subgroup, Equation 2.19 holds only for \\(g\\in \\mathbb{Z}_k\\). This means the total charge \\(\\sum_i q_i\\) should vanish only modulo \\(k\\) for the correlator to be nonzero.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMixed-gravitational anomaly\n\n\n\n\n\nThe symmetry we discuss here does not suffer from anomaly and the Ward-Takahashi idendity (Equation 2.18) follows. If we instead consider the topological operator corresponding to a symmetry with mixed-gravitational anomaly, the invariance of the measure (Equation 2.13) does not necessarily hold when \\(M_M\\) does not have the topology of a ball, and likewise Equation 2.15 can fail when \\(W_0\\) is not a ball. Thus, on a spacetime with non-trivial topology (other than \\(\\mathbb{R}^4\\) or \\(S^4\\)), (Equation 2.18) might fail at the last equality, while (by choosing \\(W_0\\) to be a ball) other steps goes through. The failure is by a phase depending on topology of the spacetime, and has an interesting consequences of this discussed in (Córdova and Ohmori 2020).",

This also indicates that the parameter \\(\\alpha\\) is \\(2\\pi\\) periodic. According to Table 1.1, this topological operator should define a \\(\\U(1)\\) \\(p\\)-form symmetry with \\(p=(\\stdim-2)\\), called the winding symmetry.\nWhat are the operators charged under the symmetry? When \\(p \\ge 1\\) (\\(\\stdim\\ge 3\\)), the operator Equation 3.3 cannot act on a local (point) operator, because the one-dimensional submanifold \\(\\gamma^1\\) can always be deformed one configuration to another without colliding with a point. On the other hand, it can potentially act on a \\(p\\)-dimensional extended operator: Figure 3.1.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.1: Action of \\(p\\)-form symmetry operator \\(U_\\alpha[W^{D-p-1}]\\) on a \\(p\\)-dimensional operator \\(\\mathcal{O}_q[\\Sigma^p]\\) of \\(p\\)-form charge \\(q\\). We can consider the two types of actions, one is encircling action (left), and the other is the passing action (right). From the latter we can close the loop on the right of the \\(\\mathcal{O}_q\\), and contract the loop on the right hand side, to get the former type of action.\n\n\n\nHowever, the construction of a charged operator is a bit tricky. A way of doing it is to first insert the identity operator Equation 3.1, then utilize the field \\(V\\) on the identity operator to defing an operator charged under Equation 3.3. Concretely, the (non-topological) operator with winding charge \\(n\\) can be constructed as \\[\n\\langle \\mathcal{O}^\\text{winding}_n[\\Sigma^{D-2}] \\rangle\n= \\int \\mathcal{D}^{W^{\\stdim-1}}V \\exp\\left(\\frac{\\imunit}{2\\pi}\\int_{W^{\\stdim-1}} \\mathop{dV}\\left(\\phi_L-\\phi_R\\right)+\\imunit n \\int_{\\Sigma^{\\stdim-2}}V\\right).\n\\tag{3.4}\\] Here, we take arbitrary \\(W^{\\stdim-1}\\) that contains \\(\\Sigma^{\\stdim-2}\\), and the correlator is independent of the choice.

    "section": "3.3 Mixed Anomaly between Shift and Winding Symmetry",
    "text": "3.3 Mixed Anomaly between Shift and Winding Symmetry\n\n3.3.1 Intersection\nHaving explicit descriptions of topological operators enables us to directly compute quantum anomaly (often called ’t Hooft anomaly) of the symmetries. This is because, from a modern perspective, the anomaly is a subtlety arises when symmetry operators collide. Here we observe one example of anomaly – the mixed anomaly between the shift and winding symmetry in the compact boson theory – explicitly from the topological operator perspective. For a general theory about anomaly and topological operator, readers can consult other resources, e.g. Tachikawa (2019).\nLet us study the intersection of \\(U_\\alpha^\\text{shift}[W^{\\stdim-1}]\\) (Equation 3.2) and \\(U_\\beta^\\text{winding}[\\gamma^1]\\) (Equation 3.3). FIXME:figure The shift symmetry operator divides \\(\\gamma^1\\) into \\(\\gamma^1_L\\) and \\(\\gamma^1_R\\), and the winding operator thus now, naively, look like \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nU^\\text{shift}_\\alpha U^\\text{winding}_\\beta[\\gamma^1] &\\stackrel{\\text{naive}}{=} U^\\text{shift}_\\alpha \\exp\\left(\\imunit\\beta \\left(\\int_{\\gamma^1_L}\\frac{\\mathop{d\\phi_L}}{2\\pi} + \\int_{\\gamma^1_R}\\frac{\\mathop{d\\phi_R}}{2\\pi}\\right)\\right)\\\\\n& \\sim U^\\text{shift}_\\alpha \\exp\\left(\\imunit\\beta/2\\pi (\\phi_L(x_0) - \\phi_R(x_0)) \\right),\n\\end{aligned}\n\\] where in the second line, \\(\\sim\\) refers to the contribution local to the intersection point \\(x_0\\) (i.e. we ignored the contribution from the other ends of \\(\\gamma^1_L\\) and \\(\\gamma^1_R\\) far from \\(W^{\\stdim-1}\\)). However, the shift symmetry defect enforces \\(\\phi_L = \\phi_R - \\alpha \\mod 2\\pi\\), but the local contribution at \\(x_0\\) depends on \\(\\phi_L-\\phi_R \\mod 2\\pi\\). Therefore the naive definition of intersected operator is not well-defined (or, it becomes zero if we average over the branches of \\(\\phi_L(x_0) -\\phi_R(x_0)\\)).\nA way to define the intersection is to abandon the periodicity of either of \\(\\alpha\\) or \\(\\beta\\). If we regard \\(\\alpha\\) to be in \\(\\mathbb{R}\\) and not \\(\\mathbb{R}/2\\pi\\mathbb{Z}\\), we can modify the above naive definition to be \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nU^\\text{shift}_\\alpha U^\\text{winding}_\\beta[\\gamma^1] &\\stackrel{\\text{def1}}{=} U^\\text{shift}_\\alpha \\exp\\left(\\imunit\\beta \\left(\\int_{\\gamma^1_L}\\frac{\\mathop{d\\phi_L}}{2\\pi} + \\int_{\\gamma^1_R}\\frac{\\mathop{d\\phi_R}}{2\\pi} + \\{\\alpha/2\\pi\\}\\right)\\right)\\\\\n& \\sim U^\\text{shift}_\\alpha \\exp\\left(\\imunit\\beta [\\alpha/2\\pi] \\right),\n\\end{aligned}\n\\] where \\([r]\\) is the integer part of a real number \\(r\\), and \\(\\{r\\}= r-[r]\\). With this definition, or regularization, of the intersection, \\(\\alpha\\) is no longer periodic, but \\(\\beta\\) is kept periodic. One can do other regularizations where \\(\\alpha\\) is periodic but \\(\\beta\\) is not, or just abandon both of periodicity, but cannot save both.\nThis incompatibility of periodicity, or the group multiplication law, when topological operators intersects is the hallmark of anomaly.\n\n\n3.3.2 Group Cohomology\nThe incompatibility above is better characterized as a group cohomology (or its generalization to a higher-group). Here we see how to characterize the mixed anomaly of the compact boson in 1+1d as a group cohomology element. (Here we do not delve into the general theory of group cohomology. See e.g. Tachikawa (2019)).\nIn 1+1d, both \\(U^\\text{shift}_\\alpha\\) and \\(U^\\text{winding}_\\beta\\) are line operators. Both operators are \\(2\\pi\\) periodic in its parameters, when intersection between them are absent. A more precise statement that applies even with intersections is that \\(U^\\text{shift}_\\alpha\\) and \\(U^\\text{shift}_{\\alpha+2\\pi}\\) can be connected with an invertible topological line-changing operator or a line-isomrphism operator for short2 (See also Figure 3.2): \\[\n\\exp\\left(\\frac{\\imunit}{2\\pi} \\int^\\square \\mathop{dV}(\\phi_L-\\phi_R -\\alpha)  + \\imunit V(\\square)  + \\frac{\\imunit}{2\\pi} \\int_\\square \\mathop{dV}(\\phi_L-\\phi_R -\\alpha+2\\pi)  \\right)\n\\] where \\(\\square\\) denotes the point connecting two line operators. Note that the winding operator \\(e^{\\imunit V(\\square)}\\) is precisely cancelled when the integral in the last term is evaluated, and thus the junction operator is topological. The existence of its inverse is also manifest.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.2: Line-isomorphism operators.\n\n\n\nLikewise, the line isomorphism operator for the winding symmetry operator is \\[\n\\exp\\left(\\imunit \\alpha \\int^{\\triangle} \\frac{d\\phi}{2\\pi} + \\imunit\\phi(\\triangle)  + \\imunit (\\alpha+2\\pi)  \\int_{\\triangle} \\frac{d\\phi}{2\\pi}  \\right).\n\\]\nWe let the composition of the two lines be denoted by \\(U_{\\alpha,\\beta} = U^\\text{shift}_\\alpha U^\\text{winding}_\\beta\\). With it, we can define “naive” junction where two line operators \\(U_{\\alpha_1,\\beta_1}\\) and \\(U_{\\alpha_2,\\beta_2}\\) fusing into \\(U_{\\alpha_1+\\alpha_2,\\beta_1+\\beta_2}\\). However, the fused operator in general has parameters in the fundamental domain other than those of the fused ones. Therefore, we normalize the junction by using the \\(\\square\\) and \\(\\triangle\\) isomorphisms so that the output is \\(U_{\\langle \\alpha_1+\\alpha_2\\rangle, \\langle \\beta_1+\\beta_2\\rangle}\\), where \\(\\langle \\alpha \\rangle = 2\\pi\\{\\alpha/2\\pi\\}\\); see Figure 3.3. The point is that this isomorphism results in a phase when crossing an intersection of the lines.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.3: The definition of junction fusing two \\(U_{\\alpha,\\beta}\\)’s into one.\n\n\n\nNow, we consider the two consecutive junctions, which fuses three lines \\(U_{\\langle\\alpha_i\\rangle,\\langle\\beta_i\\rangle}\\) (\\(i=1,2,3\\)) into \\(U_{\\langle\\sum_i \\alpha_i\\rangle,\\langle\\sum_j \\beta_j \\rangle}\\); see Figure 3.4.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.4: The anomalous phase from the F-move. We let \\(\\alpha_{12} = \\alpha_1+\\alpha_2\\), etc.\n\n\n\nThere are two ways of such fusion as depicted in the figure, and the two are related by a nontrivial phase which is \\[\nf(g_1,g_2,g_3) = \\alpha_1\\left[\\frac{\\langle\\beta_2\\rangle}{2\\pi}+\\frac{\\langle\\beta_3\\rangle}{2\\pi}\\right]+\\beta_3\\left[\\frac{\\langle\\alpha_1\\rangle}{2\\pi}+\\frac{\\langle\\alpha_2\\rangle}{2\\pi}\\right],\n\\tag{3.5}\\] where \\(g_i = (\\alpha_i,\\beta_i)\\in U(1)^2\\). The two configurations are gauge-equivalent, yet there is a non-trivial phase relating them. This is the anomalous phase of this anomalous \\(U(1)^2\\) symmetry of 1+1d compact boson.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGroup cohomology\n\n\n\nMathematically speaking, the function \\(f : (U(1)^2)^3 \\to \\mathbb{R}/2\\pi\\mathbb{Z}\\) is a 3-cocycle on the group \\(G=U(1)^2\\); it satisfies the pentagon identity, depicted in ?fig-pentagon.\nFuther, it is subject to an ambiguity; we can modify the junction by a phase \\(h(g_1,g_2)\\). This modifies the anomalous phase \\(f\\) as \\[ f(g_1,g_2,g_3) \\mapsto f(g_1,g_2,g_3) + (\\delta h)(g_1,g_2,g_3)\n\\] where \\(\\delta h : (U(1))^3\\to \\mathbb{R}/2\\pi\\mathbb{Z}\\) is the following function called a coboundary (FIXME:sign?): \\[\n(\\delta h)(g_1,g_2,g_3) = h(g_1,g_2) + h(g_1g_2,g_3) - h(g_1,g_2g_3) - h(g_2,g_3).\n\\] The third group cohomology is an element of the quatient group \\[\nH^3 = \\{f\\in\\Map(G^3,\\mathbb{R}/2\\pi\\mathbb{Z})\\mid\\text{pentagon eq.}\\} / \\delta(\\Map(G^3,\\mathbb{R}/2\\pi\\mathbb{Z})),\n\\] where \\(\\Map(X,Y)\\) is the abelian group of \\(Y\\) valued functions on \\(X\\) 3. This group cohomology classifies the anomalous phases of 1+1-dimensional bosonic theories with \\(G\\)-symmetry.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise: \\(\\mathbb{Z}_2\\) anomaly\n\n\n\nThe diagonal \\(\\mathbb{Z}_3\\) subgroup of \\(U(1)^2\\) generate by \\(U_{2\\pi/3,2\\pi/3}\\) is anomalous. Confirm this fact by calculating \\(f(g_1,g_2,g_3)\\) for \\(g_i\\)’s in this subgroup, and also proving that no \\(h\\) can satisfy \\(f = -\\delta(h)\\). Optionally one might consider some other finite subgroups of \\(U(1)^2\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComparison to more conventional calculation.\n\n\n\nThe mixed anomaly between the shift and winding symmetry in 1+1d compact boson is usually computed from the two-point function of the corresponding current operators. Such computation corresopnds to non-flat and infinitesimal background for the symmetries. On the other hand, inserting topological operator corresponds to flat and finite background. The two computations results in the same result is quite non-trivial, and is explained by the Chern-Weil theory.\nWhile the computation based on non-flat background is easier, it is only for continuous symmetries and not obvious how it restricts to a finite subgroup, for example.",

    "text": "3.4 T-duality\nThe compact boson in \\(\\stdim=2\\)-dimensions famously has T-duality.\nThe T-duality is equivalence between the compact boson with radius \\(R\\) and radius \\(\\frac{1}{R}\\), and maps the shift (or momentum) symmetry of one side to the winding symmetry of the other side, and vise versa. Note that this makes sense because in \\(\\stdim=2\\) the winding symmetry is a 0-form symmetry.\nWhen the radius is the self-dual radius \\(R=1\\), the duality becomes a (conventional) \\(\\mathbb{Z}_2\\) symmetry, which is a part of the larger emergent \\(\\SU(2)\\) symmetry.\nIn this section we study\n\nthe explicit construction of the T-duality topological interface connecting radius \\(R\\) and \\(1/R\\) theories (Kapustin and Tikhonov 2009), and\nits generalization giving non-invertible symmetry (i.e. self-dual topological interface) at \\(R=\\sqrt{N}\\) for an integer \\(N\\).\n\nThe latter can further be generalized to the case of rational \\(R^2\\) (Cordova and Ohmori 2023; Niro et al. 2023).\n\n3.4.1 T-duality topological interface\nHere we study the T-duality topological interface connecting two compact boson theories in \\(\\stdim=2\\)-dimensions; with radius \\(R\\) and radius \\(1/R\\). FIXME:figure! When \\(R=1\\), the interface is a topological operator within the same thoery, and thus defines a symmetry. In this case it turns out a \\(\\mathbb{Z}_2\\) symmetry, known to be contained in the larger \\(\\SU(2)\\) enhanced symmetry.\nAccording to (Kapustin and Tikhonov 2009), the partition functino involving the interface is \\[\n\\begin{multlined}\n\\langle \\mathcal{O}_L \\mathcal{I}^\\text{T}_1[W] \\mathcal{O}_R  \\rangle=\n\\int \\mathop{\\mathcal{D}^{M_L}\\phi_L}\\mathop{\\mathcal{D}^{M_R}\\phi_R}\n\\mathcal{O}_L[\\phi_L]\\mathcal{O}_R[\\phi_R]\\\\\n\\exp\\left(-\\frac{R^2}{4\\pi}\\int_{M_L}\\mathop{d\\phi_L}*\\mathop{d\\phi_L}\n-\\frac{\\imunit}{2\\pi}\\int_W \\phi_L\\mathop{d\\phi_R}\n-\\frac{1}{4\\pi R^2}\\int_{M_R}\\mathop{d\\phi_R}*\\mathop{d\\phi_R}\\right).\n\\end{multlined}\n\\tag{3.6}\\] For simplicity let us take \\(\\mathcal{O}_R =1\\), and \\(M_R\\) be a compact region in the spacetime. In this case, we expect the supposed topological-ness implies \\[\n\\langle \\mathcal{O}_L \\mathcal{I}_1^\\text{T}[W]\\rangle = \\langle \\mathcal{O}_L \\rangle.\n\\] To show this, we replace the variable \\(\\phi_R\\) with \\(F_R = d\\phi_R\\) by \\[\n\\int \\mathcal{D}\\phi_R = \\int \\mathop{\\mathcal{D}F_R} \\mathop{\\mathcal{D}\\widetilde{\\phi}_R}\n\\exp\\left(\\frac{\\imunit}{2\\pi} \\int_{M_R}\\widetilde{\\phi}_R \\mathop{dF_R}\\right),\n\\] where the periodic scalar \\(\\widetilde{\\phi}_R\\) is the Lagrange multiplier enforcing the closedness and the quantization of \\(F_R = d\\phi_R\\). Substituting this into Equation 3.6, the EOMs with respect to \\(F_R\\) are \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n    \\frac{1}{R} *d\\phi_R(x) &= \\imunit d\\widetilde\\phi_R(x) \\quad \\mathop{\\text{for}} x \\in M_R \\\\\n    \\phi_L(x) &= \\widetilde{\\phi}_R(x) \\quad \\mathop{\\text{for}} x \\in W.\n\\end{aligned}\n\\tag{3.7}\\] Substituting the former equation to the Lagrangea of \\(\\phi_R\\), we get \\[\n    \\frac{R^2}{4\\pi} \\int_{M_R}\\mathop{d\\widetilde{\\phi}_R}*\\mathop{d\\widetilde{\\phi}_R}\n\\] with is the same as for \\(\\phi_L\\), while the latter of Equation 3.7 connects \\(\\phi_L\\) and \\(\\widetilde{\\phi}_R\\) along \\(W\\). As a whole, we recover the path-integral over \\(M\\) resulting in \\(\\langle \\mathcal{O}_L \\rangle\\). For a more general topological-ness about local deformation of \\(W\\) can be derived in the same way but with more letters.\nNow, let us set \\(\\mathcal{O}_R = \\mathcal{O}^\\text{winding}_n(x)\\) and see how the topological interface acts on the operator. As the operator \\(\\mathcal{O}^\\text{winding}_n\\) in Equation 3.4 is defined on the trivial surface operator, we have to divide the manifold into three parts: \\(M_L,M_M,m_R\\), separated by \\(W_1\\) and \\(W_2\\). As the \\(M_L\\) and field on it is not going to be relevant, we suppress them in the following equations. The calculation goes as:\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\mathcal{I}_1^\\text{T} \\mathcal{O}^\\text{winding}_n(x)\n&= \\int \\mathop{\\mathcal{D}\\phi_M}\\mathop{\\mathcal{D}\\phi_R}\\mathop{\\mathcal{D}^{W_2}V}\n\\exp\\left(-S_M^{1/R}-S_R^{1/R}-\\frac{\\imunit}{2\\pi}\\int_{W_1}\\phi_L \\mathop{d\\phi_M}\\right)\\\\\n&\\times\\exp\\left(\\frac{\\imunit}{2\\pi}\\int_{W_2}\\mathop{dV}(\\phi_M-\\phi_R) + \\imunit n V(x) \\right)\\\\\n&= \\int \\mathop{\\mathcal{D}F_M}\\mathop{\\mathcal{D}F_R}\\mathop{\\mathcal{D}^{W_2}V}\\mathop{\\mathcal{D}\\widetilde\\phi_M}\\mathop{\\mathcal{D}\\widetilde\\phi_R}\\\\\n&\\times\\exp\\left(-S_M^{1/R}-S_R^{1/R}-\\frac{\\imunit}{2\\pi}(\\int_{W_1}\\phi_L \\mathop{d\\phi_M}-\\int_{M_M}\\tilde{\\phi}_M\\mathop{dF_M} - \\int_{M_R}\\tilde{\\phi}_R\\mathop{dF_R})\\right)\\\\\n&\\times\\exp\\left(+\\frac{\\imunit}{2\\pi}\\int_{W_2}\\mathop{V}(F_M-F_R) + \\imunit n V(x) \\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n\\] Now, the EOMs in terms of \\(F_M\\) and \\(F_R\\) state \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n    \\frac{1}{R} *d\\phi_{M,R} &= \\imunit d\\widetilde\\phi_{M,R}(x) \\quad \\text{on} \\;\\; M_{M,R}, \\\\\n    \\phi_L &= \\widetilde{\\phi}_M \\quad \\text{on} \\;\\; W_1,\\\\\n\\tilde{\\phi}_M &= V = \\tilde{\\phi}_R \\quad \\text{on} \\;\\; W_2.\n\\end{aligned}\n\\] Thus by substituting back we get FIXME:check the sign! \\[\n\\mathcal{I}_1^\\text{T}\\cdots\\mathcal{O}_n^\\text{winding} = \\mathcal{O}_{\\pm? n}^\\text{shift}.\n\\]\nIn addition, let us calculate \\((\\mathcal{I}_1[W]^\\text{T})^2\\). For this, we insert the defects along parallel submanifolds \\(W_1\\) and \\(W_2\\) and take the limit where the separation of the two shrinks. FIXME:figure This can be calculated as \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\mathcal{I}_1^\\text{T}[W_1]\\mathcal{I}_1^\\text{T}[W_2]\n&= \\int \\mathcal{D}^{M_M}\\phi_M \\exp(-\\imunit \\int_{W_1} \\phi_L d\\phi_M - \\imunit\\int_{W_2} \\phi_M d\\phi_R)\\\\\n&= \\int \\mathcal{D}^{W}\\phi_M \\exp(-\\imunit \\int_{W} (\\phi_L - \\phi_R) d\\phi_M)\\\\\n&= \\id[W],\n\\end{aligned}\n\\] where in the second line we collide \\(W_1\\) and \\(W_2\\), and noted that only the mode of \\(\\phi_M\\) constant along the direction perpendicular to \\(W_1\\) and \\(W_2\\) contributes. Therefore, the T-duality interface squares to the identity. In particular, at \\(R=1\\), the self-interface defines an invertible \\(\\mathbb{Z}_2\\) symmetry.\n\n\n3.4.2 Non-invertible symmetry from T-duality\nChoi et al. (2022) generalized the Kapustin-Tikhonov T-duality interface by Kapustin and Tikhonov (2009) as \\[\n\\begin{multlined}\n\\langle \\mathcal{O}_L \\mathcal{I}^\\text{T}_N[W] \\mathcal{O}_R  \\rangle=\n\\int \\mathop{\\mathcal{D}^{M_L}\\phi_L}\\mathop{\\mathcal{D}^{M_R}\\phi_R}\n\\mathcal{O}_L[\\phi_L]\\mathcal{O}_R[\\phi_R]\\\\\n\\exp\\left(-\\frac{R^2}{4\\pi}\\int_{M_L}\\mathop{d\\phi_L}*\\mathop{d\\phi_L}\n-\\frac{\\imunit N}{2\\pi}\\int_W \\phi_L\\mathop{d\\phi_R}\n-\\frac{N^2}{4\\pi R^2}\\int_{M_R}\\mathop{d\\phi_R}*\\mathop{d\\phi_R}\\right).\n\\end{multlined}\n\\tag{3.8}\\] This interface is a self-interface at \\(R=\\sqrt{N}\\). The same procedure as we did for \\(\\mathcal{I}_1\\) leads to \\[\n\\begin{multlined}\n\\langle\\mathcal{O}_L \\mathcal{I}^\\text{T}_N[W] \\rangle=\n\\int \\mathop{\\mathcal{D}^{M_L}\\phi_L}\\mathop{\\mathcal{D}^{M_R}\\phi_R}\\mathop{\\mathcal{D}^{W}V'}\n\\mathcal{O}_L[\\phi_L]\\\\\n\\exp\\left(-\\frac{R^2}{4\\pi}\\int_{M_L}\\mathop{d\\phi_L}*\\mathop{d\\phi_L}\n-\\frac{\\imunit }{2\\pi}\\int_W (N \\phi_L - \\widetilde{\\phi}_R)\\mathop{dV}\n-\\frac{R^2}{4\\pi N^2}\\int_{M_R}\\mathop{d\\widetilde\\phi_R}*\\mathop{d\\widetilde\\phi_R}\\right).\n\\end{multlined}\n\\tag{3.9}\\] We further rescale the fields as\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nV' &= NV \\\\\nN \\widetilde\\phi_R' &= \\widetilde\\phi_R \\mod 2\\pi\n\\end{aligned}\n\\] so that we have \\[\n\\begin{multlined}\n\\langle\\mathcal{O}_L \\mathcal{I}^\\text{T}_N[W] \\rangle = \\mathcal{N}\n\\int \\mathop{\\mathcal{D}^{M_L}\\phi_L}\\mathop{\\mathcal{D}^{M_R}\\phi_R}\\mathop{\\mathcal{D}^{W}V'}\n\\mathcal{O}_L[\\phi_L]\\\\\n\\exp\\left(-\\frac{R^2}{4\\pi}\\int_{M_L}\\mathop{d\\phi_L}*\\mathop{d\\phi_L}\n-\\frac{\\imunit }{2\\pi}\\int_W ( \\phi_L - \\widetilde{\\phi}_R')\\mathop{dV'}\n-\\frac{R^2}{4\\pi}\\int_{M_R}\\mathop{d\\widetilde\\phi_R'}*\\mathop{d\\widetilde\\phi_R'}\\right).\n\\end{multlined}\n\\tag{3.10}\\] To go from Equation 3.10 to Equation 3.9, we define a \\(\\mathbb{Z}_N\\) valued variable \\(n_{\\widetilde{\\phi'}_R} = [N\\widetilde{\\phi'}_R/2\\pi] \\mod N\\) so that \\(\\widetilde{\\phi'} = \\frac{2\\pi}{N}(\\{\\widetilde{\\phi}/2\\pi\\} + 2\\pi n_{\\widetilde{\\phi'}_R})\\). Then, after substituting it, the sum over \\(n_{\\widetilde{\\phi'}}\\) enforces \\(V'\\) be divisible by \\(N\\) (that is, the winding of \\(V\\) along \\(W\\) is constrained to be a multiple of \\(N\\)). Thus, we have \\[\\langle\\mathcal{O}_L \\mathcal{I}_N^\\text{T}[W]\\rangle = \\mathcal{N} \\langle \\mathcal{O}_L \\rangle.\n\\] We are not caring enough about the absolute size of path-integral measure to determine the normalization constant \\(\\mathcal{N}\\), but will determined in by another mean later.\n\n3.4.2.1 Fusion rule\nThe product, or fusion of the generalized operator is \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n(\\mathcal{I}_N^\\text{T})^2 &= \\int \\mathcal{D}^W V \\exp(\\frac{\\imunit}{2\\pi} N \\int_W \\mathop{dV}(\\phi_L-\\phi_R))\\\\\n&= \\sum_{n=0}^{N-1} \\int \\mathcal{D}^W V' \\exp(\\frac{\\imunit}{2\\pi}  \\int_W \\mathop{dV}(\\phi_L-\\phi_R+ 2\\pi n/N))\\\\\n&= \\sum_{n=0}^{N-1} U_{2\\pi n/N}^{\\text{shift}},\n\\end{aligned}\n\\tag{3.11}\\] where in the second line we did the chage of variable \\(NV = V'\\), and enforced the divisibility of \\(V'\\) by \\(N\\) by the sum over \\(n\\). One can also see \\(\\mathcal{I}_N^\\text{T}[-W] = \\mathcal{I}_N^\\text{T}[W]\\) (note that when we consider an operator on \\(W\\) the notion of “left” and “right” also flips), so \\[\n\\mathcal{I}_N^\\text{T}[W]\\mathcal{I}_N^\\text{T}[-W] = \\sum_{n=0}^{N-1} U_{2\\pi n/N}^{\\text{shift}}.\n\\] This contrasts to the case of conventional symmetry operator, where \\(U_g[W] = U_{g^{-1}}[W]\\) and thus \\[\nU_g [W] U_g[-W] = \\id[W].\n\\] In the case of \\(\\mathcal{I}_N^\\text{T}\\), \\(N\\ge 2\\), the fusion with its orientation reversal is not the trivial operator, but a sum. This is a one of hallmarks of non-invertible symmetry. \\(\\mathcal{I}_N^\\text{T}[-W]\\), called the dual of the original operator, is the closest possible thing to be the “inverse”, but it fails to be so. Therefore, the compact boson theory in 1+1d at \\(R=\\sqrt{N}\\) has the non-invertible T-duality symmetry.\nHere, we can determine that the coefficient in the above equations are correct. This is because that we can insert the one-dimensional operator \\((\\mathcal{I}_N^\\text{T})^2\\) along the time direction, which should determine the defect Hilbert space. On the right hand side, we should have a direct sum of defect Hilbert spaces for the involved invertible symmetry operators. There is no way to take “average” over Hilbert spaces, or divide it by a number, so we can assume the minimal possible coefficient is realized, which is the one in Equation 3.11.\nGiven Equation 3.11, the coefficient \\(\\mathcal{N}\\) in Equation 3.10 is determined by \\[\n\\langle (\\mathcal{I}_N^\\text{T})^2[W] \\rangle = \\sum_{n=0}^{N-1}\\langle U_{2\\pi n/N}^\\text{shift}[W] \\rangle = \\mathcal{N}^2,\n\\] thus \\(\\mathcal{N} = \\sqrt{N}\\). This quantity is called the quantum dimension of \\(\\mathcal{I}_N^\\text{T}\\).\n\n\n3.4.2.2 Action on the local operators\nWhat is the action of \\(\\mathcal{I}_N^\\text{T}\\) on the local operator \\(\\mathcal{O}^\\text{winding}_n\\)? Naively repeating the procedure in the previous section, one might think \\[\n\\mathcal{I}_N^\\text{T} \\cdot \\mathcal{O}^\\text{winding}_n(x) \\stackrel{?}{=} \\mathcal{O}^\\text{shift}_{n/N}(x)\n\\] however the left hand side, \\(e^{\\imunit n/N \\phi}\\), does not make sense when \\(N\\) does not divide \\(n\\) as it is incompatible with the periodicity of \\(\\phi\\). Thus the right hand side vanishes unless \\(N | n\\), and we have \\[\n\\mathcal{I}_N^\\text{T} \\cdot \\mathcal{O}^\\text{winding}_n(x) =\n\\begin{cases}\ne^{\\imunit \\frac{n}{N}\\phi} & N|n \\\\\n0 & \\text{otherwise}.\n\\end{cases}\n\\] Note that here we considered the encircling action (FIXME:Figure!!). We can instead consider the passing action, in which case we have \\[\n\\mathcal{I}_N^\\text{T}[W_L]  \\mathcal{O}^\\text{winding}_n(x) =\ne^{\\imunit \\frac{n}{N}\\int_{\\gamma^x} \\mathop{d\\phi}} \\mathcal{I}_N^\\text{T}[W_R],\n\\] \\(W_{L,R}\\) goes through the left/right side of the point \\(x\\), and the path \\(\\gamma^x\\) starts from a point on \\(W_R\\) and ends at \\(x\\).\n\n\n\n3.4.3 Non-invertible T-duality for a rational \\(R\\)\nWe can further generalize Equation 3.8 so that it is a self duality at \\(R^2 = p/q\\) (\\(p\\) and \\(q\\) are taken to be coprime) (Cordova and Ohmori 2023; Niro et al. 2023). The construction is \\[\n\\mathcal{I}_{p,q}^\\text{T}[W]=\\int \\mathop{\\mathcal{D}^W a} \\mathop{\\mathcal{D}^W b} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\imunit}{2\\pi}  \\int_W (q \\mathop{a} \\mathop{db} +p \\mathop{a} \\mathop{d\\phi_L} - b \\mathop{d\\phi_R} )\\right),\n\\] where \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are periodic scalar fields on \\(W\\). The fusion is \\[\n(\\mathcal{I}_{p,q}^\\text{T}[W])^2 = \\sum_{n_1=0}^{p-1}\\sum_{n_2=0}^{q-1}U^\\text{shift}_{2\\pi n_1/N}U^\\text{winding}_{2\\pi n_2/N},\n\\] and the quantum dimension is \\[\n\\langle \\mathcal{I}_{p,q}^\\text{T}[W]\\rangle = \\sqrt{pq}.\n\\]\n\n\n\n\nChoi, Y., Cordova, C., Hsin, P.-S., Lam, H.

In other words the gauge fixing procedure is implicit in this lecture.↩︎\nIn the language of category theory, such an invertible topological line-changing operator defines an isomorphism between the lines. In (higher)-category theory it is important to distinguish being isomorphic from being “the same”, and in this context physically it means that we remember the total derivative terms on the line.↩︎\nWhen \\(G\\) is continuous, the definition of \\(\\Map(G^n,\\mathbb{R}/2\\pi\\mathbb{Z})\\) is subtle. The particular cocycle \\(f\\) in Equation 3.5 is not continuous, so we do not want \\(\\Map(X,Y)\\) to mean continuous maps. On the other hand arbitrary discontinuous maps would contain too wild cocycles to be realized in a QFT. In this particular case it seems considering piecewise continuous functions is necessary and sufficient. For general cases in general dimensions KO is not sure.↩︎",

We will correct it later.\n\n\nIn Chapter 2 we saw that the symmetry transformation by \\(g \\in G\\) of the Lagrangian (density) can acompany a surface turm \\(ds(\\phi,g)\\) with some \\((D-1)\\)-form \\(s(\\phi,g)\\). Further, the assosiativity of the transformations imply that we have Equation 2.4 (repeating here) \\[\ns(\\phi^{g_2},g_1) + s(\\phi,g_2) = s(\\phi,g_1g_2) + ds^{(1)}(\\phi,g_1,g_2),\n\\tag{A.1}\\] with some \\((D-2)\\) forms \\(s^{(1)}(\\phi,g_1,g_2)\\).\nThis structure continues when \\(D\\ge 3\\). At the next level, by repeatingly using Equation A.1, we get \\[\n\\begin{split}\ns(\\phi,g_1g_2g_3) &= s(\\phi^{g_3},g_1g_2) + s(\\phi,g_3) - ds^{(1)}(\\phi,g_1g_2,g_3)\\\\\n&= s(\\phi^{g_2g_3},g_1) + s(\\phi^{g_3},g_2) + s(\\phi,g_3) - ds^{(1)}(\\phi^{g_3},g_1,g_2) - ds^{(1)}(\\phi,g_1g_2,g_3),\n\\end{split}\n\\] and also \\[\n\\begin{split}\ns(\\phi,g_1g_2g_3) &= s(\\phi^{g_2g_3},g_1) + s(\\phi,g_2g_3) - ds^{(1)}(\\phi,g_1,g_2g_3)\\\\\n&= s(\\phi^{g_2g_3},g_1) + s(\\phi^{g_3},g_2) + s(\\phi,g_3) - ds^{(1)}(\\phi,g_2,g_3) - ds^{(1)}(\\phi,g_1,g_2g_3),\n\\end{split}\n\\] and thus \\[\ns^{(1)}(\\phi^{g_3},g_1,g_2) + s^{(1)}(\\phi,g_1g_2,g_3) - s^{(1)}(\\phi,g_2,g_3) - s^{(1)}(\\phi,g_1,g_2g_3) = ds^{(2)}(\\phi,g_1,g_2,g_3),\n\\] with some \\((D-3)\\)-forms \\(s^{(2)}(\\phi,g_1,g_2,g_3)\\). The structure continues until \\(s^{(D-1)}(\\phi,g_1,g_2,\\cdots,g_D)\\) which are 0-forms.\nLet \\(s^{(-1)}\\) be the metric independent part of \\(\\mathcal{L}\\), and \\(s^{(0)}=s\\). The tuple \\((s^{(-1)},s^{(0)},\\cdots,s^{(D-1)})\\) defineds an degree-\\(D\\) equivariant cohomology class \\(\\mathbf{s} \\in H_G^D(X,\\mathbb{R})\\). The model[^model] of the equivariant cohomology realized by \\((s^{(-1)},s^{(0)},\\cdots)\\) is called simplicial de Rham cohomology, see e.g. (Dupont 1978; Kübel and Thom 2018).
