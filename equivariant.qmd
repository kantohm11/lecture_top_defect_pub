## Classical Symmetry in Sigma Model and equivariant cohomology {#sec-equivariant}

:::{.callout-warning}
The first part of this appendix is sloppy on purpose. We will correct it later.
:::

In @sec-scalar we saw that the symmetry transformation by $g \in G$ of the Lagrangian (density) can acompany a surface turm $ds(\phi,g)$ with some $(D-1)$-form $s(\phi,g)$.
Further, the assosiativity of the transformations imply that we have @eq-surface-term-assosiative (repeating here)
$$ 
s(\phi^{g_2},g_1) + s(\phi,g_2) = s(\phi,g_1g_2) + ds^{(1)}(\phi,g_1,g_2),
$${#eq-surface-term-assosiative-app}
with some $(D-2)$ forms $s^{(1)}(\phi,g_1,g_2)$.

This structure continues when $D\ge 3$.
At the next level, by repeatingly using @eq-surface-term-assosiative-app, we get
$$
\begin{split}
s(\phi,g_1g_2g_3) &= s(\phi^{g_3},g_1g_2) + s(\phi,g_3) - ds^{(1)}(\phi,g_1g_2,g_3)\\
&= s(\phi^{g_2g_3},g_1) + s(\phi^{g_3},g_2) + s(\phi,g_3) - ds^{(1)}(\phi^{g_3},g_1,g_2) - ds^{(1)}(\phi,g_1g_2,g_3),
\end{split}
$$
and also
$$
\begin{split}
s(\phi,g_1g_2g_3) &= s(\phi^{g_2g_3},g_1) + s(\phi,g_2g_3) - ds^{(1)}(\phi,g_1,g_2g_3)\\
&= s(\phi^{g_2g_3},g_1) + s(\phi^{g_3},g_2) + s(\phi,g_3) - ds^{(1)}(\phi,g_2,g_3) - ds^{(1)}(\phi,g_1,g_2g_3),
\end{split}
$$
and thus
$$
s^{(1)}(\phi^{g_3},g_1,g_2) + s^{(1)}(\phi,g_1g_2,g_3) - s^{(1)}(\phi,g_2,g_3) - s^{(1)}(\phi,g_1,g_2g_3) = ds^{(2)}(\phi,g_1,g_2,g_3),
$$
with some $(D-3)$-forms $s^{(2)}(\phi,g_1,g_2,g_3)$.
The structure continues until $s^{(D-1)}(\phi,g_1,g_2,\cdots,g_D)$ which are 0-forms.

Let $s^{(-1)}$ be the metric independent part of $\mathcal{L}$, and $s^{(0)}=s$.
The tuple $(s^{(-1)},s^{(0)},\cdots,s^{(D-1)})$ defineds an degree-$D$ **equivariant cohomology class** $\mathbf{s} \in H_G^D(X,\mathbb{R})$. 
The model[^model] of the equivariant cohomology realized by $(s^{(-1)},s^{(0)},\cdots)$ is called simplicial de Rham cohomology, see e.g. [@dupont1978curvature;@kubel2018equivariant].
Note that this model works for discrete groups, as opposed to the Weyl model based on Lie derivatives that applies to continuous groups.

Now we point out the sloppiness; there are two points:

- A
- B
