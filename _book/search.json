    "text": "2.1 Symmetry\nSymmetry plays a fundamental role in theoretical physics. In this lecture we consider them in quantum field theories (QFTs). The fundamental fact about symmetry in QFTs is that is it preserved along the renormalization group flow. More precisely, when an ultraviolet (UV) theory \\(\\mathcal{T}_\\text{UV}\\) flows into an infrared theory \\(\\mathcal{T}_\\text{IR}\\), there is a canonical homomorphism \\(f_\\text{RG}\\) from the UV symmetry group \\(G_\\text{UV}\\) to the IR symmetry group \\(G_\\text{IR}\\):1\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRG flow homomorphism from UV symmetry to IR symmetry\n\n\n\n\\[\nf_\\text{RG} : G_\\text{UV} \\to G_\\text{IR}.\n\\tag{2.1}\\]\n\n\nGiven this relation, there are two ways of applying symmetry in QFT:\n\nUV to IR: Given a microscopic model (e.g. a model of elementary particles or electrons in a matter), constrain/guess what happens in the macroscopic scale.\nIR to UV: Given some macroscopic phenomena, constrain/guess what could be the microscopic origin of it (e.g. guessing QCD lagrangian from hadron spectrum).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nIn this lecture, whenever something is called “symmetry”, it means a global symmetry. Here global means that the symmetry operation acts on the entire space. In addition, in most contents we exclude symmetries acting on the spacetime out of consideration for simplicity."

    "section": "2.2 Locality",
    "text": "2.2 Locality\nThe second important keyword in this lecture is locality. By the word quantum field theory, in most cases we implicitly mean local quantum field theory. This can roughly be explain that the action is written as the integration of Lagrangian density, which is a local functional of fields over the spacetime.\nLocality of QFT has a concequence with respect to symmetry: that is, in most situations we only consider symmetries that preserves locality. In terms of fields, this means that the symmetry transformation is local:\n\\[\n\\phi(x) \\mapsto F(\\phi(x)),\n\\tag{2.2}\\] where \\(F(\\phi(x))\\) is a function depends on the local value a field (or a collection of fields and its derivatives) at the point \\(x\\). If the symmetry involves a spacetime transformation, the point \\(x\\) in the right hand side should be replaced by the image of \\(x\\) under the symmetry. This preservation of locality of a symmetry is the reason for the symmetry relation in Equation 2.1. This will be made clear in the lecture.\nHowever, not all the (locality-preserving) symmetry in QFT takes the form of Equation 2.2. There are types of symmetry called “topological symmetry”, which arises from topologically-nontrivial field configuration. Examples are the winding symmetry in 1+1d compact boson, and the monopole symmetries in 2+1d abelian gauge theories. In many occurences a topological symmetry is mapped to a symmetry of type of Equation 2.2 under a duality, and thus it should also be considered as being locality-preserving.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nAgain, we are not talking about gauge redundancy, which is sometimes called local symmetry. Global symmetries one encounters in a QFT textbook are all locality preserving.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nHere is another unfortunate conflict of terminology. In the literature (outside of generalized symmetry literature), a “topological defect” refers to a dynamical object, or its trajectory viewed as an operator in the IR theory, charged under a topological (higher) symmetry. In this lecture (and widely in the generalized symmetry literature) “topological defect operator” means an extended operator that is itself topological."

    "text": "If the UV theory is a fixed point, \\(G_\\text{UV}\\) should be understood as the one preserved by the perturbation triggering the RG flow. If the RG flow is to a lower nonzero energy, and if one retains all the (even very massive) degrees of freedom in the description of \\(\\mathcal{T}_\\text{IR}\\), the map \\(f_\\text{RG}\\) is an isomorphism. However, typically one integrates out massive dofs in the description of \\(\\mathcal{T}_\\text{RG}\\), in which case some symmetry can decouple and thus \\(f_\\text{RG}\\) can be non-surjective. Also, if one also drops some higher-order interaction terms, or runs the flow to the zero energy, there can be an emergent symmetry, in which case \\(f_\\text{RG}\\) can be non-injective.↩︎"

    "text": "1.3 Other Lectures/Reviews\nRecently there has been a surge of lecture notes/ review articles on generalized symmetries. The ones I have noticed are (Bhardwaj et al. 2023; Gomes 2023; Luo et al. 2023; McGreevy 2022; Schafer-Nameki 2023; Shao 2023). Because this lecture will focus on the fundamental aspects of the topic and will not connect very well with the existent literature (so sorry about that), readers/audiences are strongly encouraged to refer to at least one of them, or something similar.\nAlso, about conventional symmetries and their anomalies, there are nice old lectures. The one I would particularly recommend is (Tachikawa 2019).\n\n\n\n\nBhardwaj, L., Bottini, L. E., Fraser-Taliente, L., Gladden, L., Gould, D. S. W., Platschorre, A., and Tillim, H.
