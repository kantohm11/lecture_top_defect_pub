    "text": "1.3 Other Lectures/Reviews\nRecently there has been a surge of lecture notes/ review articles on generalized symmetries. The ones I have noticed are (McGreevy 2022; Schafer-Nameki 2023; Gomes 2023; Bhardwaj et al. 2023; Luo, Wang, and Wang 2023; Shao 2023). Because this lecture will focus on the fundamental aspects of the topic and will not connect very well with the existent literature (so sorry about that), readers/audiences are strongly encouraged to refer to at least one of them, or something similar.\nAlso, about conventional symmetries and their anomalies, there are nice old lectures. The one I would particularly recommend is (Yuji 2019).\n\n\n\n\nBhardwaj, Lakshya, Lea E. Bottini, Ludovic Fraser-Taliente, Liam Gladden, Dewi S. W.

    "text": "2.1 Symmetry\nSymmetry plays a fundamental role in theoretical physics. In this lecture we consider them in quantum field theories (QFTs). The fundamental fact about symmetry in QFTs is that is it preserved along the renormalization group flow. More precisely, when an ultraviolet (UV) theory \\(\\mathcal{T}_\\text{UV}\\) flows into an infrared theory \\(\\mathcal{T}_\\text{IR}\\), there is a canonical homomorphism \\(f_\\text{RG}\\) from the UV symmetry group \\(G_\\text{UV}\\) to the IR symmetry group \\(G_\\text{IR}\\):1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\[\nf_\\text{RG} : G_\\text{UV} \\to G_\\text{IR}.\n\\tag{2.1}\\]\n\n\n\nGiven this relation, there are two ways of applying symmetry in QFT:\n\nUV to IR: Given a microscopic model (e.g. a model of elementary particles or electrons in a matter), constrain/guess what happens in the macroscopic scale.\nIR to UV: Given some macroscopic phenomena, constrain/guess what could be the microscopic origin of it (e.g. guessing QCD lagrangian from hadron spectrum).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nIn this lecture, whenever something is called “symmetry”, it means a global symmetry. Here global means that the symmetry operation acts on the entire space."

However, typically one integrates out massive dofs in the description of \\(\\mathcal{T}_\\text{RG}\\), in which case some symmetry can decouple and thus \\(f_\\text{RG}\\) can be non-surjective (if \\(G_\\text{IR}\\) is taken to be the faithful symmetry). Also, if one also drops some higher-order interaction terms, or runs the flow to the zero energy, there can be an emergent symmetry, in which case \\(f_\\text{RG}\\) can be non-injective.↩︎"
