    "text": "2.1 Symmetry\nSymmetry plays a fundamental role in theoretical physics. In this lecture we consider them in quantum field theories (QFTs). The fundamental fact about symmetry in QFTs is that is it preserved along the renormalization group flow. More precisely, when an ultraviolet (UV) theory \\(\\mathcal{T}_\\text{UV}\\) flows into an infrared theory \\(\\mathcal{T}_\\text{IR}\\), there is a canonical homomorphism \\(f_\\text{RG}\\) from the UV symmetry group \\(G_\\text{UV}\\) to the IR symmetry group \\(G_\\text{IR}\\):1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\[\nf_\\text{RG} : G_\\text{UV} \\to G_\\text{IR}.\n\\tag{2.1}\\]\n\n\n\nGiven this relation, there are two ways of applying symmetry in QFT:\n\nUV to IR: Given a microscopic model (e.g. a model of elementary particles or electrons in a matter), constrain/guess what happens in the macroscopic scale.\nIR to UV: Given some macroscopic phenomena, constrain/guess what could be the microscopic origin of it (e.g. guessing QCD lagrangian from hadron spectrum).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nIn this lecture, whenever something is called “symmetry”, it means a global symmetry. Here global means that the symmetry operation acts on the entire space."

    "text": "If the RG flow is from a finite energy to a lower nonzero energy, and if one retains all the (even very massive) degrees of freedom in the description of \\(\\mathcal{T}_\\text{IR}\\), \\(f_\\text{RG}\\) is an isomorphism. However, typically one integrates out massive dofs in the description of \\(\\mathcal{T}_\\text{RG}\\), in which case some symmetry can decouple and thus \\(f_\\text{RG}\\) can be non-surjective (if \\(G_\\text{IR}\\) is taken to be the faithful symmetry). Also, if one also drops some higher-order interaction terms, or runs the flow to the zero energy, there can be an emergent symmetry, in which case \\(f_\\text{RG}\\) can be non-injective.↩︎"
