    "text": "1.1 Symmetry\nSymmetry plays a fundamental role in theoretical physics. In this lecture we consider them in quantum field theories (QFTs). The fundamental fact about symmetry in QFTs is that is it preserved along the renormalization group flow. More precisely, when an ultraviolet (UV) theory \\(\\mathcal{T}_\\text{UV}\\) flows into an infrared theory \\(\\mathcal{T}_\\text{IR}\\), there is a canonical homomorphism \\(f_\\text{RG}\\) from the UV symmetry group \\(G_\\text{UV}\\) to the IR symmetry group \\(G_\\text{IR}\\):1\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRG flow homomorphism from UV symmetry to IR symmetry\n\n\n\n\\[\nf_\\text{RG} : G_\\text{UV} \\to G_\\text{IR}.\n\\tag{1.1}\\]\n\n\nGiven this relation, there are two ways of applying symmetry in QFT:\n\nUV to IR: Given a microscopic model (e.g. a model of elementary particles or electrons in a matter), constrain/guess what happens in the macroscopic scale.\nIR to UV: Given some macroscopic phenomena, constrain/guess what could be the microscopic origin of it (e.g. guessing QCD lagrangian from hadron spectrum).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTerminology\n\n\n\nIn this lecture, “symmetry” means a global symmetry. Here global means that the symmetry operation acts on the entire space. In addition, in most contents we exclude symmetries acting on the spacetime out of consideration for simplicity."

    "section": "1.2 Locality",
    "text": "1.2 Locality\nThe second important keyword in this lecture is locality. By the word quantum field theory, in most cases we implicitly mean local quantum field theory. This can roughly be explain that the action is written as the integration of Lagrangian density, which is a local functional of fields over the spacetime.\nLocality of QFT has a concequence with respect to symmetry: that is, in most situations we only consider symmetries that preserves locality. In terms of fields, this means that the symmetry transformation is local:\n\\[\n\\phi(x) \\mapsto F(\\phi(x)),\n\\tag{1.2}\\] where \\(F(\\phi(x))\\) is a function depends on the local value a field (or a collection of fields and its derivatives) at the point \\(x\\). If the symmetry involves a spacetime transformation, the point \\(x\\) in the right hand side should be replaced by the image of \\(x\\) under the symmetry. This preservation of locality of a symmetry is the reason for the symmetry relation in Equation 1.1. This will be made clear in the lecture.\nHowever, not all the (locality-preserving) symmetry in QFT takes the form of Equation 1.2. There are types of symmetry called “topological symmetry”, which arises from topologically-nontrivial field configuration. Examples are the winding symmetry in 1+1d compact boson, and the monopole symmetries in 2+1d abelian gauge theories. In many occurrences a topological symmetry is mapped to a symmetry of type of Equation 1.2 under a duality, and thus it should also be considered as being locality-preserving.\nFrom the modern perspective, the universal characterization of locality-preserving symmetries is its correspondence to topological operators. A topological operator \\(\\mathcal{D}[M_n]\\) in a QFT is an extended operator defined on a \\(n\\)-dimensional submanifold of the spacetime and the correlators containing it should be invariant under the smooth deformation of the supporting manifold \\(M_n\\) (See Figure 1.1).\n\n\n\nFigure 1.1: Topological operator.\n\n\nThe first aim of the lecture is to understand the correspondence, that is\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSymmetry/Topological Operator Correspondence\n\n\n\n\\[\\begin{split}\n&\\text{(Conventional) locality-preserving symmetry} \\\\\n&\\Longleftrightarrow\\;\n\\text{invertible topological operator of codimension 1.}\n\\end{split}\n\\tag{1.3}\\]\n\n\nWe will explicitly study this correspondence in the case of scalar field theory in Chapter 2 and in the case of abelian gauge theory in Chapter 3. The case of fermion is very interesting and crucial, but it will be remained to be worked out by audiences/readers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTerminology\n\n\n\nAgain, we are not talking about gauge redundancy, which is sometimes called local symmetry. Global symmetries one encounters in a QFT textbook are all locality preserving.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTerminology\n\n\n\nHere is another unfortunate conflict of terminology. In the literature (outside generalized symmetry literature), a “topological defect” refers to a dynamical object, or its trajectory viewed as an operator in the IR theory, charged under a topological (higher) symmetry. As an operator in the IR theory, it is not a priori guaranteed to be topological in the sense of Figure 1.1 . On the other hand, in the generalized symmetry literature, “topological defect (operator)” often means an extended operator that is itself topological. In this lecture, in order to ease the confusion, we use the term “topological operator”."

    "text": "1.3 Generalized Symmetry\nThe correspondence in Equation 1.3 is the core in the notion of generalized (global) symmetry, coined by (Gaiotto et al. 2015) 2.

Therefore, we define generalized symmetry by the following correspondence generalizing Equation 1.3:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGeneralized Symmetry/Topological Operator Correspondence\n\n\n\n\\[\\begin{split}\n&\\text{Generalized symmetry (in a ``usual\" QFT)} \\\\\n&\\stackrel{\\text{def}}{\\Longleftrightarrow}\\;\n\\text{General topological operator.}\n\\end{split}\n\\tag{1.4}\\]\n\n\nMore specifically, a generalized symmetry corresponding to a operator of codimension \\(p+1\\) is called \\(p\\)-form symmetry, and a generalized symmetry corresponding to a operator without its inverse is called non-invertible symmetry (among other names like category symmetry and topological symmetry).\nIn an “unsual” QFT, we can even relax the topological-ness of the operator in the right hand side of Equation 1.4, resulting in what is called subsystem symmetry. We will briefly make a comment on it.\nThe sub-classes of generalized symmetry is summarized in the table below:\n\n\n\n\n\\(p\\)-form\nnon-invertible\nsubsystem\n\n\n\n\ncodimension\n\\(p+1\\)\n\n\n\n\nInvertible?\n\nNo\n\n\n\nTopological?\n\n\nPartically\n\n\n\nThe sub-classes are not mutually exclusive, so, in principle, there can be a 2-form non-invertible subsystem symmetry.\n\n\n\n\nBarkeshli, M., Bonderson, P., Cheng, M., and Wang, Z.
