    "text": "1.1 Other Lectures/Reviews\nRecently there has been a surge of lecture notes/ review articles on generalized symmetries. The ones I have noticed are\n\n(Schafer-Nameki 2023)\n(Gomes 2023)\n(Bhardwaj et al. 2023)\n(Luo, Wang, and Wang 2023)\n(Shao 2023)\n\nThere are probably more. Because this lecture will focus on the fundamental aspects of the topic and will not connect very well with the existent literature (so sorry about that), readers/audiences are strongly encouraged to refer to at least one of them, or something similar.\nAlso, about conventional symmetries and their anomalies, there are nice old lectures. The one I would particularly recommend is (Yuji 2019).\n\n\n\n\nBhardwaj, Lakshya, Lea E. Bottini, Ludovic Fraser-Taliente, Liam Gladden, Dewi S. W.
