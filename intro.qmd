# Introduction

## Symmetry
**Symmetry** plays a fundamental role in theoretical physics. 
In this lecture we consider them in *quantum field theories* (QFTs). 
The fundamental fact about symmetry in QFTs is that is it preserved along the renormalization group flow.
More precisely, when an ultraviolet (UV) theory $\mathcal{T}_\text{UV}$ flows into an infrared theory $\mathcal{T}_\text{IR}$, there is a canonical homomorphism $f_\text{RG}$ from the UV symmetry group $G_\text{UV}$ to the IR symmetry group $G_\text{IR}$:[^SymRG]

f_\text{RG} : G_\text{UV} \to G_\text{IR}.

Given this relation, there are two ways of applying symmetry in QFT:

* UV to IR: Given a microscopic model (e.g. a model of elementary particles or electrons in a matter), constrain/guess what happens in the macroscopic scale.
* IR to UV: Given some macroscopic phenomena, constrain/guess what could be the microscopic origin of it (e.g. guessing QCD lagrangian from hadron spectrum).

[^SymRG]: If the RG flow is from a finite energy to a lower nonzero energy, and if one retains all the (even very massive) degrees of freedom in the description of $\mathcal{T}_\text{IR}$, $f_\text{RG}$ is an isomorphism.
However, typically one integrates out massive dofs in the description of $\mathcal{T}_\text{RG}$, in which case some symmetry can decouple and thus $f_\text{RG}$ can be non-surjective (if $G_\text{IR}$ is taken to be the *faithful* symmetry). Also, if one also drops some higher-order interaction terms, or runs the flow to the zero energy, there can be an *emergent* symmetry, in which case $f_\text{RG}$ can be non-injective.

In this lecture, whenever something is called "symmetry", it means a *global* symmetry.
Here *global* means that the symmetry operation acts on the entire space.

## Locality
The second important keyword in this lecture is **locality**.
