# Introduction

## Symmetry
**Symmetry** plays a fundamental role in theoretical physics. 
In this lecture we consider them in *quantum field theories* (QFTs). 
The fundamental fact about symmetry in QFTs is that is it preserved along the renormalization group flow.
More precisely, when an ultraviolet (UV) theory $\mathcal{T}_\text{UV}$ flows into an infrared theory $\mathcal{T}_\text{IR}$, there is a canonical homomorphism $f_\text{RG}$ from the UV symmetry group $G_\text{UV}$ to the IR symmetry group $G_\text{IR}$:[^SymRG]

Given this relation, there are two ways of applying symmetry in QFT:

* UV to IR: Given a microscopic model (e.g. a model of elementary particles or electrons in a matter), constrain/guess what happens in the macroscopic scale.
* IR to UV: Given some macroscopic phenomena, constrain/guess what could be the microscopic origin of it (e.g. guessing QCD lagrangian from hadron spectrum).

[^SymRG]: If the UV theory is a fixed point, $G_\text{UV}$ should be understood as the one preserved by the perturbation triggering the RG flow. If the RG flow is to a lower nonzero energy, and if one retains all the (even very massive) degrees of freedom in the description of $\mathcal{T}_\text{IR}$, the map $f_\text{RG}$ is an isomorphism.
However, typically one integrates out massive dofs in the description of $\mathcal{T}_\text{RG}$, in which case some symmetry can decouple and thus $f_\text{RG}$ can be non-surjective. Also, if one also drops some higher-order interaction terms, or runs the flow to the zero energy, there can be an *emergent* symmetry, in which case $f_\text{RG}$ can be non-injective.

In this lecture, whenever something is called "symmetry", it means a *global* symmetry.
Here *global* means that the symmetry operation acts on the entire space.

## Locality
The second important keyword in this lecture is **locality**.
By the word quantum field theory, in most cases we implicitly mean *local* quantum field theory.
This can roughly be explain that the action is written as the integration of Lagrangian density, which is a local functional of fields over the spacetime.

Locality of QFT has a concequence with respect to symmetry: that is, in most situations we only consider symmetries that *preserves locality*. 
In terms of fields, this means that the symmetry transformation is local:

$$
\phi(x) \mapsto F(\phi(x'))
$$
