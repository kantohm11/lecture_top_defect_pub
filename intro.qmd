# Introduction

## Symmetry
**Symmetry** plays a fundamental role in theoretical physics. 
In this lecture we consider them in *quantum field theories* (QFTs). 
The fundamental fact about symmetry in QFTs is that is it preserved along the renormalization group flow.
More precisely, when an ultraviolet (UV) theory $\mathcal{T}_\text{UV}$ flows into an infrared theory $\mathcal{T}_\text{IR}$, there is a canonical homomorphism $f_\text{RG}$ from the UV symmetry group $G_\text{UV}$ to the IR symmetry group $G_\text{IR}$:[^SymRG]

Given this relation, there are two ways of applying symmetry in QFT:

* UV to IR: Given a microscopic model (e.g. a model of elementary particles or electrons in a matter), constrain/guess what happens in the macroscopic scale.
* IR to UV: Given some macroscopic phenomena, constrain/guess what could be the microscopic origin of it (e.g. guessing QCD Lagrangian from hadron spectrum).

[^SymRG]: If the UV theory is a fixed point, $G_\text{UV}$ should be understood as the one preserved by the perturbation triggering the RG flow. If the RG flow is to a lower nonzero energy, and if one retains all the (even very massive) degrees of freedom in the description of $\mathcal{T}_\text{IR}$, the map $f_\text{RG}$ is an isomorphism.
However, typically one integrates out massive dofs in the description of $\mathcal{T}_\text{RG}$, in which case some symmetry can decouple and thus $f_\text{RG}$ can be non-surjective. Also, if one also drops some higher-order interaction terms, or runs the flow to the zero energy, there can be an *emergent* symmetry, in which case $f_\text{RG}$ can be non-injective.

### Terminology
In this lecture, "symmetry" means a *global* symmetry.
Here *global* means that the symmetry operation acts on the entire space. In addition, in most contents we exclude symmetries acting on the spacetime out of consideration for simplicity.

## Locality
The second important keyword in this lecture is **locality**.
By the word quantum field theory, in most cases we implicitly mean *local* quantum field theory.
This can roughly be explained by that the action is written as the integration of Lagrangian density, which is a local functional of fields over the spacetime.

Locality of QFT has a consequence with respect to symmetry: that is, in most situations we only consider symmetries that *preserves locality*. 
In terms of fields, this means that the symmetry transformation is local:

$$
\phi(x) \mapsto F(\phi(x)),
$${#eq-field-transform}
where $F(\phi(x))$ is a function depends on the *local* value a field (or a collection of fields and its derivatives) at the point $x$.
If the symmetry involves a spacetime transformation, the point $x$ in the right-hand side should be replaced by the image of $x$ under the symmetry.
This preservation of locality of a symmetry is the reason for the symmetry relation in @eq-RG-group-match.
This will be made clear in the lecture.

However, not all the (locality-preserving) symmetry in QFT takes the form of @eq-field-transform. 
There are types of symmetry called "topological symmetry", which arises from topologically-nontrivial field configuration.
Examples are the winding symmetry in 1+1d compact boson, and the monopole symmetries in 2+1d abelian gauge theories.
In many occurrences a topological symmetry is mapped to a symmetry of type of @eq-field-transform under a duality, and thus it should also be considered as being locality-preserving.

From the modern perspective, the universal characterization of locality-preserving symmetries is its correspondence to **topological operators**. 
A topological operator $\mathcal{D}[W_n]$ in a QFT is an extended operator defined on a $n$-dimensional submanifold of the spacetime and the correlators containing it should be invariant under the smooth deformation of the supporting manifold $W_n$ (See @fig-TopOpsDeform).

The first aim of the lecture is to understand the correspondence, that is

### Symmetry/Topological Operator Correspondence
$$\begin{split}
&\text{(Conventional) locality-preserving symmetry} \\ 
&\Longleftrightarrow\;
\text{invertible topological operator of codimension 1.}
\end{split}
$${#eq-conv-STO-corresp}
:::
In this correspondence, the topological operator shoould be regarded as the generalization of the **Noether charge** into possibly discrete symmetry.
To be precise, we regard this correspondence as the right-hand side *defining* the left-hand side.
We will explicitly check this correspondence/definition reproduces the known symmetries in the case of scalar field theory in @sec-scalar and in the case of abelian gauge theory in @sec-vector. The case of fermion is very interesting and crucial, but it will be remained to be worked out by audiences/readers.

### Terminology
Again, we are *not* talking about gauge redundancy, which is sometimes called local symmetry. Global symmetries one encounters in a QFT textbook are all locality preserving.

### Terminology
Here is another unfortunate conflict of terminology. In the literature (outside generalized symmetry literature), a "topological defect" refers to a dynamical object, or its trajectory viewed as an operator in the IR theory, charg**ed** under a topological (higher) symmetry. As an operator in the IR theory, it is *not* a priori guaranteed to be topological in the sense of @fig-TopOpsDeform . On the other hand, in the generalized symmetry literature, "topological defect (operator)" often means an extended operator that is itself topological. In this lecture, in order to ease the confusion, we use the term "topological operator".

## Generalized Symmetry

The correspondence in @eq-conv-STO-corresp is the core in the notion of **generalized (global) symmetry**, 
coined by [@Gaiotto:2014kfa] [^GKSW].
That is, the notion of symmetry can be generalized by relaxing the adjective in the right-hand side of @eq-conv-STO-corresp. 
Therefore, we *define* generalized symmetry by the following correspondence generalizing @eq-conv-STO-corresp:

::: {.callout-important}
### Generalized Symmetry/Topological Operator Correspondence
$$\begin{split}
&\text{Generalized symmetry (in a ``usual" QFT)} \\ 
&\stackrel{\text{def}}{\Longleftrightarrow}\;
\text{General topological operator.}
\end{split}
$${#eq-GSTO-corresp}
:::
More specifically, a generalized symmetry corresponding to an operator of codimension $p+1$ is called **$p$-form symmetry**, and a generalized symmetry corresponding to an operator without its inverse is called **non-invertible symmetry** (among other names like category symmetry and topological symmetry).

In an "unusual" QFT, we can even relax the topological-ness of the operator in the right-hand side of @eq-GSTO-corresp, resulting in what is called **subsystem** symmetry. We will briefly make a comment on it in @sec-somewhere.

The sub-classes of generalized symmetry is summarized in the table below:

|              | $p$-form | non-invertible | subsystem  |
|--------------|----------|----------------|------------|
| codimension  | $p+1$    |                |            |
| Invertible?  |          | No             |            |
| Topological? |          |                | Partically |

The subclasses are not mutually exclusive, so, in principle, there can be a 2-form non-invertible subsystem symmetry.

[^GKSW]: The global higher-form symmetry itself had appeared and investigated in the literature, e.g.\ [@Kapustin:2013uxa;@Barkeshli:2014cna], and its gauged version was essentially known from [@KalbRamond].
