# Introduction

## Symmetry

**Symmetry** plays a crucial role in theoretical physics. 
In this lecture, we will discuss its application in *quantum field theories* (QFTs). 
A fundamental aspect of symmetry in QFTs is its preservation along the renormalization group flow.
More precisely, when an ultraviolet (UV) theory $\mathcal{T}_\text{UV}$ transitions into an infrared theory $\mathcal{T}_\text{IR}$, 
a canonical homomorphism $f_\text{RG}$ exists from the UV symmetry group $G_\text{UV}$ to the IR symmetry group $G_\text{IR}$:


**Symmetry** is a cornerstone concept in theoretical physics.
Particularly within the context of *quantum field theories* (QFTs).
A key principle in QFTs is the preservation of symmetry throughout the renormalization group flow.
To elaborate, when an ultraviolet (UV) theory, denoted as $\mathcal{T}_\text{UV}$, transitions into an infrared theory, represented as $\mathcal{T}_\text{IR}$, a canonical homomorphism $f_\text{RG}$ is established.
This homomorphism maps the UV symmetry group $G_\text{UV}$ to the IR symmetry group $G_\text{IR}$:[^SymRG]

Here, if the UV theory is a fixed point, $G_\text{UV}$ should be understood as the one preserved by the deformation triggering the RG flow.

### Property of $f_\text{RG}$
The property of $f_\text{RG}$ depends on what exactly is meant by the IR theory $\mathcal{T}_\text{IR}$.
If the RG flow is to a lower nonzero energy, and the IR theory $\mathcal{T}_\text{IR}$ retains all the (even very massive) degrees of freedom and all the irrelevant interactions, 
the map $f_\text{RG}$ is an isomorphism.
However, typically one integrates out massive degrees of freedom in the description of $\mathcal{T}_\text{RG}$, 
in which case some symmetry can decouple and thus $f_\text{RG}$ can be non-surjective. 
Also, if one also drops some higher-order interaction terms, or runs the flow to zero energy, 
there can be an *emergent* symmetry, in which case $f_\text{RG}$ can be non-injective.
:::

Given this relationship, symmetry in QFT can be applied in two ways:

* UV to IR: Starting with a microscopic model (e.g., a model of elementary particles or electrons in matter), we can use symmetry to constrain or predict what happens on a macroscopic scale.
* IR to UV: Given certain macroscopic phenomena, we can use symmetry to constrain or infer the possible microscopic origins (e.g., inferring the QCD Lagrangian from the hadron spectrum).


## Locality

One of the defining characteristics of symmetry in quantum field theories (QFTs) is its *preservation of locality*. 
In the context of classical symmetry in fields, this means that the symmetry transformation is local:

$$
\phi(x) \mapsto F(\phi(x')),
$${#eq-field-transform}

In this equation, $F(\phi(x'))$ is a function that relies solely on the *local* value of a field (or a set of fields and its derivatives) at a point $x'$.
When $x'\neq x$, the symmetry involves a *spacetime* symmetry, while when $x'=x$, it is an *internal* symmetry.
The preservation of locality in a symmetry underpins the symmetry relation in @eq-RG-group-match, which will be elaborated further in the lecture.

#### Note
Please note that a QFT, when quantized on a fixed space manifold $M$, does possess unitary operators that commute with its Hamiltonian, other than those originating from locality-preserving symmetry. 
In most cases, such unitary operators are irrelevant; an example is the one that multiplies a phase to a specific eigenstate.
Therefore, in this lecture, when we refer to a symmetry, we assume that it preserves locality.
In fact, we assert that this property is the *last* one to be discarded in the context of generalized symmetry, if ever, due to the invariance under the renormalization group flow. [^ColemanMandula]

[^ColemanMandula]: Also, note that the Colman-Mandula theorem assumes a strong locality-preserving condition; that the symmetry generators act on multi-particle asymptotic states as tensor products.

### Terminology (Locality-Preserving)
To avoid confusion, it's important to note that locality-preserving symmetry does *not* mean gauge redundancy, which is sometimes labeled as local symmetry. The global -- spacetime, or internal -- symmetries typically encountered in a QFT textbook all preserve locality.
:::


However, not all symmetries in QFT that preserve locality take the form of @eq-field-transform, i.e., a *classical* symmetry. 
Other types of symmetries exist, such as *topological symmetry* or *quantum symmetry*, which emerge from topologically nontrivial field configurations.
Examples include the winding symmetry in 1+1d compact boson, and the monopole symmetries in 2+1d abelian gauge theories.
In many cases, a topological/quantum symmetry is mapped to a symmetry of the type @eq-field-transform under a duality, and thus it should also be considered as preserving locality.

From a contemporary standpoint, the universal characterization of locality-preserving symmetries is their correspondence to **topological operators**. 
A topological operator $\mathcal{D}[W_n]$ in a QFT is an extended operator defined on an $n$-dimensional submanifold of the spacetime. The correlators that include it should remain invariant under the smooth deformation of the supporting manifold $W_n$ (See @fig-TopOpsDeform).

The first goal of this lecture is to understand the following correspondence:

### Symmetry/Topological Operator Correspondence
$$\begin{split}
&\text{(Conventional) locality-preserving symmetry} \\ 
&\Longleftrightarrow\;
\text{invertible topological operator of codimension 1.}
\end{split}
$${#eq-conv-STO-corresp}
:::
In this correspondence, the topological operator should be viewed as a generalization of the **Noether charge** for potentially discrete symmetry.
More precisely, we consider this correspondence as the right-hand side *defining* the left-hand side.
We will explicitly verify that this correspondence/definition reproduces the known symmetries in the case of a classical symmetry in a scalar field theory in @sec-scalar, and in the case of abelian gauge theory in @sec-vector. The case of fermions is both intriguing and crucial, but it will be left as an exercise, or a work, for the audience/readers.

### Terminology (Topological Defect)
There exists an unfortunate discrepancy in terminology. Outside the realm of generalized symmetry literature, a "topological defect" typically refers to a dynamical object, or its trajectory, viewed as an operator in the IR theory. As an operator in the IR theory, it is *not* necessarily topological in the sense of @fig-TopOpsDeform. Conversely, within the generalized symmetry literature, "topological defect (operator)" often signifies an extended operator that is inherently topological. To mitigate potential confusion in this lecture, we will adopt the term "topological operator", even when the supporting submanifold of the operator is not within a time-slice.

## Generalized Symmetry

The concept of **generalized (global) symmetry** is fundamentally based on the correspondence in @eq-conv-STO-corresp, as introduced by [@Gaiotto:2014kfa] [^GKSW].
This concept expands the traditional notion of symmetry by loosening the constraints on the right-hand side of @eq-conv-STO-corresp. 
Hence, we *define* generalized symmetry through the following correspondence, which extends @eq-conv-STO-corresp:

::: {.callout-important}
### Generalized Symmetry/Topological Operator Correspondence
$$\begin{split}
&\text{Generalized symmetry (in a ``usual" QFT)} \\ 
&\stackrel{\text{def}}{\Longleftrightarrow}\;
\text{General topological operator.}
\end{split}
$${#eq-GSTO-corresp}
:::

In more specific terms, a generalized symmetry that corresponds to an operator of codimension $p+1$ is referred to as a **$p$-form symmetry**. 
Meanwhile, a generalized symmetry that corresponds to an operator without an inverse is known as a **non-invertible symmetry** (also referred to as category symmetry or topological symmetry).

In the context of an "unusual" QFT, the topological constraint on the operator in the right-hand side of @eq-GSTO-corresp can be further relaxed. 
This leads to the concept of **subsystem** symmetry, which will be briefly mentioned in @sec-trivial-scalar, but will not be discussed in detail in this lecture.

The table below summarizes the subclasses of generalized symmetry:

|              | $p$-form | non-invertible | subsystem  |
|--------------|----------|----------------|------------|
| codimension  | $p+1$    |                |            |
| Invertible?  |          | No             |            |
| Topological? |          |                | Partially  |

:Subclasses of generalized symmetry and defining properties of their corresponding topological operators. {#tbl-sym-classes}

These subclasses are not mutually exclusive. Therefore, in theory, a 2-form non-invertible subsystem symmetry could exist, for example.

[^GKSW]: The concept of global higher-form symmetry has been previously explored and investigated in the literature, for example, in [@Kapustin:2013uxa;@Barkeshli:2014cna]. Its gauged version was essentially known from [@KalbRamond].
